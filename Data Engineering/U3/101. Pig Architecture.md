==**Pig Architecture**== consists of several key components that facilitate data processing in a distributed environment like Hadoop:

1. **Pig Latin Scripts**: Users write scripts in the **Pig Latin language**, which defines data flow (loading, transforming, and storing data).

2. **Parser**: The script is passed to the **Parser**, which checks for syntax errors and generates a **Logical Plan**. This plan is a series of steps for transforming the data.

3. **Optimizer**: The Logical Plan is optimized using techniques like **combining multiple steps** or **reordering operations** to enhance performance.

4. **Compiler**: The optimized plan is converted into a **Physical Plan**, which consists of **MapReduce jobs** or other execution engines like **Tez** or **Spark**.

5. **Execution Engine**: The Physical Plan is executed on the underlying distributed system (e.g., Hadoop), running the generated **MapReduce jobs** to process data.

6. **Result**: The final output is stored or presented based on the **STORE** or **DUMP** command.

In short, Pigâ€™s architecture translates high-level scripts into optimized MapReduce tasks, abstracting the complexity of Hadoop processing.

# **Pig Workflow**

The **workflow in Apache Pig** follows these key steps:

1. **Write Pig Script**: The user writes a **Pig Latin script** to define data operations like loading, transforming, and storing data.

2. **Submit Script**: The script is submitted for execution using the Pig interface (Grunt shell, PigServer, or embedded mode).

3. **Parsing**: The **Parser** checks the script for syntax errors and generates a **Logical Plan**, which represents the series of transformations on the data.

4. **Optimization**: The **Optimizer** improves the logical plan by applying techniques like removing unnecessary steps and reordering operations for efficiency.

5. **Compilation**: The optimized plan is translated into a **Physical Plan**, typically consisting of one or more **MapReduce jobs**.

6. **Execution**: The **Execution Engine** submits these jobs to the **Hadoop cluster**, where they are executed in parallel.

7. **Result**: Once the jobs are complete, the **results** are stored using the **STORE** command or displayed using the **DUMP** command.

### Key Points:
- **Logical Plan**: High-level plan based on the Pig script.
- **Optimization**: Increases efficiency by restructuring operations.
- **Physical Plan**: Converts the logical plan into MapReduce tasks.
- **Execution**: Jobs run in parallel on the Hadoop cluster.

# **Pig Execution Methods**

### 1. Interactive Mode (Grunt Shell)

- **How it works:** Directly type Pig commands into the Grunt shell.
- **Advantages:** Ideal for quick exploration and testing of Pig scripts.
- **Example:**
    
    ```pig
    grunt> A = LOAD 'data.txt' AS (col1, col2);
    grunt> B = FOREACH A GENERATE col1 + col2 AS sum;
    grunt> DUMP B;
    ```
    

### 2. Batch Mode (Pig Scripts)

- **How it works:** Create a Pig script file (.pig) and execute it using the `pig` command.
- **Advantages:** Suitable for larger, more complex scripts and automation.
- **Example:**
    
    ```pig
    # my_script.pig
    A = LOAD 'data.txt' AS (col1, col2);
    B = FOREACH A GENERATE col1 + col2 AS sum;
    DUMP B;
    ```
    
    ```pig
    pig my_script.pig
    ```
    

### 3. Embedded Mode (PigServer)

- **How it works:** Integrate Pig commands into Java applications using the `PigServer` class.
- **Advantages:** Provides flexibility for combining Pig with Java logic.
- **Example:**

  ```java
    import org.apache.pig.PigServer;
    
    public class PigExample {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            PigServer pigServer = new PigServer("local");
            pigServer.setBatchOn();
            pigServer.registerQuery("A = LOAD 'data.txt' AS (col1, col2);");
            pigServer.registerQuery("B = FOREACH A GENERATE col1 + col2 AS sum;");
            pigServer.registerQuery("DUMP B;");
        }
    }
    ```
