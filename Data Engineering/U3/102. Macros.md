In **Pig Latin**, **macros** are a way to define reusable pieces of logic that can be invoked multiple times within a script. A **macro** is essentially a block of Pig Latin code that you can parameterize and reuse to avoid repetition and make your scripts more modular and maintainable.

### **Key Points**:
- Macros in Pig Latin are similar to functions in other programming languages.
- They allow you to define a sequence of operations once and invoke them multiple times with different parameters.
- Macros help simplify complex scripts by encapsulating frequently used logic.

### **Syntax for Defining a Macro**:
```pig
DEFINE macro_name (parameter1, parameter2, ...) RETURNS output { 
    -- Pig Latin code here
    statement1;
    statement2;
    ...
};
```
- **DEFINE**: Keyword to define a macro.
- **macro_name**: Name of the macro.
- **parameters**: Input parameters for the macro.
- **RETURNS**: Specifies the output that the macro will return.
- The body of the macro contains the Pig Latin statements to be executed.

### **Example: Basic Macro Usage**

Let's say you have a common task of filtering data based on a condition, and you need to perform this operation in multiple places in your script.

#### Input Data (`student_data.txt`):
```
John,20,85
Alice,22,90
Bob,21,85
David,22,88
```

Load the data:
```pig
students = LOAD 'student_data.txt' USING PigStorage(',') AS (name:chararray, age:int, grade:int);
```

Now, define a macro to filter students by age and grade:
```pig
DEFINE filter_students_by_age_and_grade(data, min_age, min_grade) RETURNS filtered_data {
    filtered_data = FILTER data BY (age >= min_age) AND (grade >= min_grade);
};
```

This macro takes in:
- `data`: The relation to be filtered.
- `min_age`: The minimum age for the filter.
- `min_grade`: The minimum grade for the filter.

### **Using the Macro**:

You can now call this macro with different parameters.

#### Example 1: Filter students older than 21 and with grades above 85
```pig
filtered_1 = filter_students_by_age_and_grade(students, 21, 85);
DUMP filtered_1;
```

**Output**:
```
(Alice, 22, 90)
(David, 22, 88)
```

#### Example 2: Filter students older than 20 and with grades above 85
```pig
filtered_2 = filter_students_by_age_and_grade(students, 20, 85);
DUMP filtered_2;
```

**Output**:
```
(Alice, 22, 90)
(Bob, 21, 85)
(David, 22, 88)
```

### **Example: Macro with Multiple Steps**

You can define more complex macros that perform multiple operations.

#### Task:
You need to **load data**, **filter based on conditions**, and **calculate the average grade** of the filtered students.

#### Define the macro:
```pig
DEFINE process_students(data, min_age, min_grade) RETURNS result {
    filtered_data = FILTER data BY (age >= min_age) AND (grade >= min_grade);
    grouped_data = GROUP filtered_data ALL;
    result = FOREACH grouped_data GENERATE AVG(filtered_data.grade);
};
```

### **Using the Macro**:
```pig
avg_grade_1 = process_students(students, 21, 85);
DUMP avg_grade_1;
```

**Output**:
```
(89.0)  -- Average grade of students older than 21 with grade >= 85
```

### **Advantages of Using Macros**:
1. **Code Reusability**: You can reuse the same block of Pig Latin code multiple times with different parameters, reducing code duplication.
2. **Maintainability**: If you need to change the logic, you only modify it in one place.
3. **Readability**: Macros make the script cleaner and easier to understand, especially when dealing with complex operations.

---

### **Limitations**:
- Macros are not as flexible as UDFs (User-Defined Functions) since they are still limited by the syntax of Pig Latin.
- You cannot return multiple relations from a macro.

---

### **Summary**:
- **Macros in Pig Latin** are used to encapsulate a series of Pig statements that you want to reuse.
- They take **input parameters** and return a relation or value.
- Macros help in simplifying scripts by making them modular and reducing redundancy.

By using macros, you can create cleaner and more efficient Pig scripts, especially when dealing with complex logic or repetitive operations.
