### **Spark Components**:

1. **Spark Core**:
    
    - The ==engine for large-scale parallel and distributed data processing==. It provides the basic functionalities of ==task scheduling, memory management, fault recovery==, and ==distributed storage.==
2. **Spark SQL**:
    
    - A ==module for working with structured data using SQL queries==. It allows querying data via SQL, as well as providing a DataFrame API that is optimized for distributed processing.
3. **Spark Streaming**:
    
    - A module for real-time data processing. It ==allows for processing streams of data in near real-time by breaking down data into small batches and processing them==.
4. **MLlib**:
    
    - A l==ibrary for machine learning==. It ==provides tools for classification, regression, clustering, collaborative filtering, dimensionality reduction, and more.==
5. **GraphX**:
    
    - A library for ==graph processing and computation.== It provides an API for building and processing graphs and performing graph-parallel computations.
