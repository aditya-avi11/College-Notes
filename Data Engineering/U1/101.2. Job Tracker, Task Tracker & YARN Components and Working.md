### **JobTracker in Hadoop**

1. **Central Coordination**: Acts as the central coordinator for job execution in a Hadoop cluster.
2. **Job Management**: Receives job submissions from clients and manages the entire lifecycle of a job.
3. **Task Assignment**: Splits the job into tasks and assigns them to TaskTrackers across the cluster.
4. **Resource Monitoring**: Monitors the progress of tasks and ensures resource utilization is optimized.
5. **Failure Handling**: Detects task failures and reschedules them on different TaskTrackers.
6. **Progress Reporting**: Provides job status and progress updates to clients.

### **TaskTracker in Hadoop**

1. **Task Execution**: Executes the tasks assigned by the JobTracker on the local data node.
2. **Resource Management**: Manages resources (CPU, memory) on the node to ensure tasks run efficiently.
3. **Heartbeat Communication**: Sends regular heartbeats to the JobTracker to report its status and task progress.
4. **Failure Reporting**: Notifies the JobTracker if a task fails, enabling the JobTracker to take corrective action.
5. **Local Data Processing**: Processes data stored locally on the node to reduce network overhead.

(Note: In Hadoop 2.x and later, YARN replaced JobTracker and TaskTracker with ResourceManager and NodeManager, respectively.)


# **YARN Components**

1. **ResourceManager**:
    
    - **Central Authority**: Manages and allocates cluster resources.
    - **Scheduler**: Assigns resources to running applications based on resource availability and policies.
    - **ApplicationManager**: Manages the life cycle of applications and monitors their progress.
2. **NodeManager**:
    
    - **Per-Node Agent**: Runs on each node in the cluster, managing resources (CPU, memory) on that node.
    - **Task Management**: Launches and monitors application containers, reporting back to the ResourceManager.
    - **Health Monitoring**: Periodically sends heartbeats to the ResourceManager to report the node's status.
3. **ApplicationMaster**:
    
    - **Per-Application Coordinator**: Manages the execution of a single application, negotiating resources with the ResourceManager.
    - **Task Scheduling**: Requests containers from the NodeManagers and monitors task execution.
    - **Failure Handling**: Manages task failures and restarts failed tasks as needed.
4. **Containers**:
    
    - **Execution Units**: Provide the environment (CPU, memory) for tasks to run. Containers are allocated by the NodeManager based on requests from the ApplicationMaster.

### **Working of YARN**

1. **Job Submission**:
    
    - The client submits a job to the ResourceManager, including application code and configuration.
2. **ApplicationMaster Launch**:
    
    - ResourceManager starts an ApplicationMaster for the job in a container on one of the nodes.
3. **Resource Negotiation**:
    
    - The ApplicationMaster negotiates resources (containers) with the ResourceManager to run the job's tasks.
4. **Task Execution**:
    
    - NodeManagers launch containers as instructed by the ApplicationMaster to execute the tasks.
    - ApplicationMaster monitors task progress and handles any task failures by requesting new containers.
5. **Completion and Cleanup**:
    
    - Once all tasks are completed, the ApplicationMaster notifies the ResourceManager.
    - The ApplicationMaster and containers are terminated, and resources are released back to the cluster.
6. **Job Status Reporting**:
    
    - The client can check job status and progress through the ResourceManager or ApplicationMaster.
