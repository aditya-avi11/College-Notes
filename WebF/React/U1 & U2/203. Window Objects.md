# Browser Object Model (BOM)

- Represents the objects that the browser provides to interact with the browser window and its component.
- Allows js to communicate with and manipulate the browser environment.
- Includes objects related to window such as : 
		- The **window** object itself (the main browser window or tab).
		- Objects like **navigator**, **screen**, **history**, **location**, and **document**
- Provides control over browser-specific functions like resizing windows, navigating to URLs, or getting browser information.

## Important BOM Objects

1. **Window Object**: Represents the browser window or tab and is the global object in client-side JavaScript.

2. **Navigator Object**: Provides information about the browser (e.g., browser name, version, user agent).

3. **Screen Object**: Represents the user's screen (resolution, height, width).

4. **History Object**: Lets you manipulate the browser session history (e.g., moving back and forward through pages).

5. **Location Object**: Represents the URL of the window and allows for navigation or URL manipulation.

### Example 1: Window Object
The **window** object is the top-level object of the BOM and represents the browser window. You can perform several actions using the `window` object like opening new windows, alerting messages, and more.

```javascript
// Displaying an alert box using window object
window.alert("Hello, BOM!");
```
Since `window` is the global object, you can omit `window` and directly use `alert()`.

### Example 2: Navigator Object
The **navigator** object provides information about the browser being used, such as the browser name, version, and user agent.

```javascript
// Display browser name and version
console.log(navigator.appName); // Output: Netscape (usually for modern browsers)
console.log(navigator.appVersion); // Outputs browser version
```

### Example 3: Location Object
The **location** object allows you to get the URL of the current page or to redirect the browser to a new page.

```javascript
// Get the current URL
console.log(window.location.href);

// Redirect to another page
window.location.href = "https://www.example.com";
```

### Example 4: History Object
The **history** object lets you navigate through the user's browser history.

```javascript
// Navigate to the previous page
window.history.back();

// Navigate to the next page
window.history.forward();
```

### Example 5: Screen Object
The **screen** object gives information about the user's screen resolution and size.

```javascript
// Display screen width and height
console.log(screen.width);  // Outputs screen width
console.log(screen.height); // Outputs screen height
```

### Summary of Common BOM Objects
- **window**: Represents the browser window/tab (global object).
- **navigator**: Provides information about the browser.
- **location**: Represents the URL and allows navigation.
- **history**: Manages browser history navigation.
- **screen**: Provides information about the user's screen resolution.

The BOM is essential for handling browser-related tasks in JavaScript beyond the web page content, like controlling navigation, history, and screen dimensions.
