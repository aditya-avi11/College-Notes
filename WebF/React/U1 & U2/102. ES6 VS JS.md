**JavaScript** and **ECMAScript** are closely related but not exactly the same thing. Here's a breakdown:

### **JavaScript**

- **What it is**: JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is primarily used for web development. It enables interactivity and dynamic content on web pages.
- **Usage**: JavaScript is primarily used for client-side scripting (in browsers) but can also be used on the server side through environments like **Node.js**.
- **Key Features**:
    - It is event-driven, non-blocking, and supports asynchronous programming (using promises, async/await).
    - It's a versatile language that supports object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.
    - JavaScript runs in browsers, enabling the creation of interactive websites.
    - JavaScript can manipulate HTML and CSS, interact with APIs, handle events, and more.

### **ECMAScript**

- **What it is**: ECMAScript (often abbreviated as **ES**) is a ==standardized specification== that serves as the foundation for scripting languages like JavaScript, JScript, and ActionScript.
- **Purpose**: The goal of ECMAScript is to standardize the scripting language so that implementations (like JavaScript) can work uniformly across different platforms and environments.
- **History**: ECMAScript was created by **ECMA International** (formerly ECMA, European Computer Manufacturers Association) in 1997. It defines the syntax, types, and other fundamental aspects of the language.

### **Key Differences**

- **JavaScript** is an implementation of the ECMAScript specification. In simple terms, JavaScript is the language you use in your code, while ECMAScript is the specification that outlines the language's features.
- **ECMAScript** is updated regularly with new versions that introduce new features and syntax improvements to JavaScript.

### **ECMAScript Versions**

ECMAScript has several versions, with the most popular being:

- **ES3 (1999)**: Introduced many of JavaScript's core features, such as regular expressions and try-catch for error handling.
- **ES5 (2009)**: Introduced stricter syntax (strict mode), JSON support, and enhanced array methods.
- **ES6 (2015)**, also known as **ECMAScript 2015**: This version introduced major new features like:
    - Arrow functions (`=>`)
    - Classes
    - Template literals (`` `Hello ${name}` ``)
    - Modules (`import`/`export`)
    - Promises
    - Let/Const for block-scoped variables
    - Default Function parameters
    - Rest Parameter (...inputs)
    - Spread Operator
    - for...of LOOP
    - Octal and Binary Literals
    - Template Literals
- **Later versions** (ES7, ES8, ES9, etc.) have continued to introduce smaller improvements, such as async/await, array methods like `flatMap()`, and new syntax features.

### **Key Features from Recent ECMAScript Versions**:

- **Async/Await** (introduced in ES8): This allows for writing asynchronous code that looks like synchronous code, improving readability and maintenance.
- **Modules** (introduced in ES6): `import` and `export` keywords to modularize code.
- **BigInt** (introduced in ES10): Allows for handling arbitrarily large integers.
- **Nullish Coalescing Operator** (`??`), **Optional Chaining** (`?.`), and **Promise.allSettled** (introduced in ES11).

### **Summary**:

- **JavaScript** is the programming language used by developers to build dynamic web applications, and it follows the rules specified by **ECMAScript**, which is the standardized version of the language.
- ECMAScript defines how JavaScript (and other implementations) should behave, while JavaScript implements those specifications in a practical, usable form for developers.

### 1. **Octal and Binary Literals**

In **ES6 (ECMAScript 2015)**, support for octal and binary literals was introduced, allowing developers to specify numbers in octal (base 8) and binary (base 2) formats.

#### **Octal Literals**

- Represented using the prefix `0o` or `0O` (zero and the letter 'o').
- Each digit must be in the range `0â€“7`.

**Example**:

```javascript
let octal = 0o17;  // Octal literal (base 8)
console.log(octal); // Output: 15 (decimal equivalent)
```

#### **Binary Literals**

- Represented using the prefix `0b` or `0B` (zero and the letter 'b').
- Each digit must be `0` or `1`.

**Example**:

```javascript
let binary = 0b1010;  // Binary literal (base 2)
console.log(binary); // Output: 10 (decimal equivalent)
```

### 2. **Template Literals**

Template literals (introduced in ES6) provide a more flexible way to work with strings. They are enclosed by **backticks** (`` ` ``) instead of single or double quotes.

#### Key Features:

1. **String Interpolation**: Insert variables or expressions directly using the `${}` syntax.
2. **Multi-line Strings**: Write strings across multiple lines without needing escape characters.
3. **Tagged Templates**: Allow custom parsing of template literals.

**Examples**:

- **String Interpolation**:

```javascript
let name = "John";
let age = 25;

let message = `Hello, my name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old.`;
console.log(message);
// Output: Hello, my name is John and I am 25 years old.
```

- **Multi-line Strings**:

```javascript
let multiLine = `This is a string
that spans across
multiple lines.`;
console.log(multiLine);
```

- **Expressions in Interpolation**:

```javascript
let a = 10, b = 20;
console.log(`The sum of a and b is ${a + b}.`); 
// Output: The sum of a and b is 30.
```

### 3. **Array Destructuring and Object Destructuring**

Destructuring allows you to ==unpack values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables== in a concise manner.

#### **Array Destructuring**

Array destructuring extracts values from an array and assigns them to variables based on their positions.

**Syntax**:

```javascript
let [var1, var2, ...rest] = array;
```

**Example**:

```javascript
let numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40];

// Destructuring
let [a, b, ...rest] = numbers;

console.log(a);     // Output: 10
console.log(b);     // Output: 20
console.log(rest);  // Output: [30, 40]
```

- **Default Values**:

```javascript
let [x, y = 5] = [1];
console.log(x); // Output: 1
console.log(y); // Output: 5 (default)
```

- **Skipping Elements**:

```javascript
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
let [first, , third] = arr;

console.log(first); // Output: 1
console.log(third); // Output: 3
```

---

#### **Object Destructuring**

Object destructuring extracts properties from an object and assigns them to variables.

**Syntax**:

```javascript
let {key1, key2, ...rest} = object;
```

**Example**:

```javascript
let person = { name: "Alice", age: 25, country: "USA" };

// Destructuring
let { name, age } = person;

console.log(name); // Output: Alice
console.log(age);  // Output: 25
```

- **Renaming Variables**:

```javascript
let person = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };

let { name: fullName, age: years } = person;

console.log(fullName); // Output: Alice
console.log(years);    // Output: 25
```

- **Default Values**:

```javascript
let user = { name: "Bob" };

let { name, country = "India" } = user;

console.log(name);    // Output: Bob
console.log(country); // Output: India (default value)
```

- **Nested Destructuring**:

```javascript
let student = {
  name: "John",
  scores: {
    math: 90,
    science: 85
  }
};

let { name, scores: { math, science } } = student;

console.log(name);    // Output: John
console.log(math);    // Output: 90
console.log(science); // Output: 85
```
