### **Shallow Parsing in NLP**

**Shallow Parsing**, also known as **Chunking**, is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) **==technique used to extract phrases (chunks) from a sentence==**. Unlike full parsing, which analyzes the entire grammatical structure of a sentence, shallow parsing identifies only the syntactically significant parts, such as noun phrases (NP), verb phrases (VP), or prepositional phrases (PP), without going deeper into their hierarchical relationships.

It operates by grouping words into meaningful units but does not delve into the internal structure of these units or their relationships with other phrases.

### **Example**

Consider the sentence:

> "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."

**Shallow Parsing Output:**

- **Noun Phrase (NP):** "The quick brown fox"
- **Verb Phrase (VP):** "jumps"
- **Prepositional Phrase (PP):** "over the lazy dog"

Here, shallow parsing focuses on identifying the phrases ("The quick brown fox", "jumps", "over the lazy dog") but does not analyze the internal structure of each phrase or their syntactic roles in the sentence.

### **Steps in Shallow Parsing**

1. **Tokenization:** Splitting the sentence into words.
    - Example: ["The", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumps", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog"]
2. **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging:** Assigning grammatical tags to words.
    - Example: [("The", "DT"), ("quick", "JJ"), ("brown", "JJ"), ("fox", "NN"), ("jumps", "VBZ"), ("over", "IN"), ("the", "DT"), ("lazy", "JJ"), ("dog", "NN")]
3. **Chunking Rules:** Applying rules to group words into phrases.
    - Example Rule: `NP â†’ DT JJ* NN` (A noun phrase starts with a determiner (DT), followed by zero or more adjectives (JJ*), and ends with a noun (NN)).

### **Applications of Shallow Parsing**

1. **Information Extraction:** Extracting entities, such as names, dates, and locations.
2. **Question Answering Systems:** Identifying relevant phrases in a query.
3. **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Detecting proper nouns and entities.
4. **Text Summarization:** Identifying key phrases for summarizing content.

Shallow parsing is computationally less expensive than full parsing, making it a practical choice for many NLP tasks.
