Image filtering involves ==applying specific operations to an image to enhance its features, remove noise, or extract meaningful patterns.== It is fundamental for tasks like preprocessing, edge detection, and texture analysis. Filters are generally classified into two categories: smoothing and sharpening, often used for blurring or highlighting details.

Purpose of Filtering: 
- Improve image quality. 
- Minimize noise and distortions. 
- Detect edges and extract features. 
- Smooth or sharpen image details. 

Filtering works by altering pixel values based on the values of neighboringpixels, enabling effects such as blurring, sharpening, or edge detection.

### **I. Blurring / Smoothing**

Blurring or smoothing is used to reduce noise or details in an image by averaging or replacing pixel values. This is commonly applied for denoising, reducing high-frequency components, or preprocessing for edge detection.

Two types of blurring filters : 
1. Smoothing Linear Filters 
2. Smoothing Non-Linear Filters
#### **1. Smoothing Linear Filters**

Linear filters operate by replacing the value of each pixel with a weighted sum of its neighboring pixels. The weights are defined by the filter kernel.

- **Box Filter (Average Filter):**
    
    - Replaces each pixel with the average value of its surrounding pixels.
    - Take the mean value of the pixels in a neighborhood, which is defined by the size of a mask (m-columns and n- rows).
    - It is important to divide by the sum of the values in the neighborhood to normalize output values.
    - Kernel example:
		$K = \frac{1}{9} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$
    - Effect: Smoothens noise but may blur edges significantly.
- **Gaussian Filter:**
    
    - A weighted average filter where closer pixels are given higher weights, following a Gaussian distribution.
    - The Gaussian filter is another linear smoothing filter, where the weight of the pixels in the neighborhood is determined by a Gaussian function. 
    - It provides a bell-shaped curve for weighting, with the highest weight at the center and progressively lower weights as we move away fromthe center.
    - Kernel example (3x3): 
    - $K = \frac{1}{16} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 1 \\ 2 & 4 & 2 \\ 1 & 2 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$
    - Effect: Reduces noise with less edge blurring compared to a box filter.

#### **2. Smoothing Non-Linear Filters**

Non-linear filters do not use a fixed weighted average, making them more effective for noise reduction without significantly blurring edges.

- **Median Filter:**
    - Replaces each pixel value with the median of its neighboring pixel values.
    - It works by sorting the pixel values in the neighborhood and replacing the central pixel with the median value.
    - Effect: Removes salt-and-pepper noise effectively while preserving edges.

Algorithm: 
- Sort the pixel values in the neighborhood. 
- Replace the central pixel with the median value.

### **II. Sharpening Filters**

- Sharpening filters are used to enhance the edges and fine details in animage. 
- These filters highlight regions where there is a significant change in pixel intensity. 
- Sharpening relies on detecting rapid intensity changes, typically found at edges in an image. 
- These intensity changes are highlighted by calculating the derivatives of pixel values.

- **First Derivative:** Measures the rate of change in pixel intensity, often used to detect edges.
- **Second Derivative:** Highlights transitions even more strongly and is used in techniques like the Laplacian filter.

#### **1. Laplacian Filter (Second Derivative):**

- The Laplacian filter enhances edges by applying a second derivative operation. It measures how much the pixel intensity changes around a given pixel.
- Kernel example: 
	$K = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -1 & 0 \\ -1 & 4 & -1 \\ 0 & -1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$
	(or, the same matrix, just change +ve to -ve & -ve top +ve)
- Effect: Highlights edges and fine details but is sensitive to noise. Often combined with smoothing filters to reduce noise before applying the Laplacian.

#### **2. Gradient-Based Filters (First Derivative):**

Gradient-based sharpening filters measure changes in intensity using the image gradient (first derivative).
The gradient measures the rate of change in intensity in horizontal (Gx) and vertical (Gy) directions.

- **Sobel Filter:**
    
    - Detects edges along horizontal and vertical directions.
    - Horizontal kernel: 
		$K_x = \begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 & 1 \\ -2 & 0 & 2 \\ -1 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$
    - Vertical kernel:
	    $K_y = \begin{bmatrix} -1 & -2 & -1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 2 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$
    - Effect: Detects edges and gradients in specified directions.

- **Prewitt Filter:**
    
    - Similar to Sobel but uses a simpler kernel structure for gradient calculation.

### **III. Edge Detection**

- Edge detection is the process of identifying boundaries in an image where there are abrupt changes in intensity. 
- It helps highlight important features like edges and outlines, which can be useful for image analysis, like identifying objects or recognizing shapes.
- It is essential for object detection, image segmentation, and computer vision tasks.
