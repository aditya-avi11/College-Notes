### **Image Transformation**

Image transformation refers to ==operations applied to images to modify their appearance, geometry, or orientation.== Transformations are essential in computer vision, image processing, and graphics, enabling tasks like resizing, rotating, or aligning images for analysis or display.
These transformations are crucial for tasks like preprocessing, data augmentation, image registration, object recognition, and feature extraction in computer vision.

### **Types of Image Transformations**

#### **1. Geometric Transformations**

- Changing the structure of an image (e.g., translation, scaling, shearing).
- It can alter the shape or position of an image.
- Geometric transformations ==change the spatial configuration of an image by altering the coordinates of its pixels.== These transformations include operations like translation, scaling, rotation, and shearing.

##### **Types of Geometric Transformations**

**a. Translation:**

- Moves an image from one location to another without altering its shape, size, or orientation.
- Achieved by adding or subtracting values to the coordinates of every pixel in the image.

**b. Scaling:**

- Changes the size of the image by enlarging or shrinking it.
- Achieved by multiplying pixel coordinates by scale factors $(Sx, Sy)$:
				$x′=Sx⋅x,  y′=Sy⋅y$

**c. Shearing:**

- Skews the image, causing the shapes to tilt in the x or y direction, distorting its geometry.
- Skews the image along one axis, making it look like it’s slanted.
- Shearing is often used to create slanted text or images.
- It lose its rectangular shape and turn into a parallelogram, while preservingthe straight lines.

**Mathematical Representation:** For shearing along the x-axis:

				$[x′, y′]=[x+shx⋅y,  y]$
				
				or, 
				
				$\begin{bmatrix} x' \\ y' \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} x + sh_x \cdot y \\ y \end{bmatrix}$

For shearing along the y-axis:

				$[x′, y′]=[x,  y+shy⋅x]$
				
				or, 
				
				$\begin{bmatrix} x' \\ y' \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y + sh_y \cdot x \end{bmatrix}$

Where $shxsh_x$ and $shysh_y$ are the shearing factors.

d. **Rotation:**
- Rotates the image around a point (usually the origin or the image center) by an angle $\theta$.
- Transformation equations:
		$x′= x cos⁡θ − y sin⁡θ,  y′ = x sin⁡θ + ycos⁡θ$

e. **Reflection (Flipping):**
- Mirrors the image along a specific axis (e.g., horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).

#### **2. Affine Transformations**

- Affine transformations are a broader class of transformations that preserve straight lines, parallelism, and ratios of distances in an image. 
- They combine geometric transformations like translation, scaling, rotation, and shearing into a single operation.
- The ==shape of objects is preserved==, but their ==size, position, and orientation may change==.

**Mathematical Representation:** 

$\begin{bmatrix} x' \\ y' \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a & b & t_x \\ c & d & t_y \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$

### **Key Differences Between Geometric and Affine Transformations**

| Feature                    | Geometric Transformations                            | Affine Transformations                       |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Scope**                  | Includes all types of transformations.               | Subset of geometric transformations.         |
| **Parallel Line Property** | May not preserve parallel lines (e.g., perspective). | Preserves parallelism of lines.              |
| **Transformation Matrix**  | Can be nonlinear (perspective transformation).       | Uses a 2x3 linear matrix for transformation. |
### **Applications of Image Transformations**

- **Computer Vision:** Object recognition, image alignment, and pattern matching.
- **Data Augmentation:** Generate diverse training datasets by applying transformations.
- **Optical Flow Analysis:** Track motion between consecutive frames using transformations.
- **Medical Imaging:** Correcting distortions in scans or aligning images for comparison.
- **Machine Learning:** Data augmentation by applying transformations to expand the training dataset.

By using these transformations, images can be manipulated for both aesthetic and functional purposes while preserving essential structural properties.
