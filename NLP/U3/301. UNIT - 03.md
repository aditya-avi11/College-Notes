# VISION
**Vision** is the field of study that enables computers to "see" and interpret images. It involves developing algorithms and techniques that allow machines to extract meaningful information from visual data. This information can then be used for various tasks, such as object recognition, image classification, and scene understanding.
**An image** is a digital representation of a visual scene. It is composed of a grid of tiny squares called **pixels**. Each pixel has a specific color and intensity value.
Pixel Values : Brightness, Color, Distance and Material.

# Computer Vision
Computer Vision is a multidisciplinary field of AI and computer science that focuses on enabling computers to interpret and understand visual information from the world, much like human vision.

While NLP helps machines understand and process language, CV helps them "see" and interpret the visual world. Both fields often intersect in tasks like: 
1) Image captioning 2) Text recognition in image 3) Visual question answering, where text and images are used together.

# The History of Computer Vision
In the 1960s, researchers began to develop algorithms to process and analyze visual data, but the technology was limited by computational power. By the 1970s, researchers had developed more sophisticated algorithms for image processing and pattern recognition. One of the key breakthroughs was the development of the Hough transform, which allowed for the detection of lines and other geometric shapes in images.In the 1980s and 1990s, researchers focused on developing machine learning algorithms for computer vision. These algorithms enabled computers to learn from data and improve accuracy over time. The Viola-Jones face detection algorithm, developed in 2001, was one of the most significant breakthroughs of this time.

In the 2000s and 2010s, deep learning algorithms revolutionized computer vision by enabling computers to learn hierarchical representations of visual data. The development of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and other deep learning algorithms enabled computers to recognize objects, track movement, and perform other complex tasks with greater accuracy than ever before.Today, computer vision is a rapidly growing field with [applications in autonomous vehicles, medical imaging, and robotics](https://www.sama.com/blog/top-5-computer-vision-applications-in-2023/) - amongst many other areas.

# **How Computer Vision Works**

Steps Involved in the Working of Computer Vision: 
1. ***Image Acquisition*** : Capturing the image or video using cameras, sensors, or other imaging devices. 
2. ***Preprocessing*** : Enhancing image quality or transforming it for further analysis. Common Techniques: Noise removal, resizing, grayscale conversion, histogram equalization, and edge detection. The goal of image processing is to prepare the visual data for further analysis in subsequent stages.
3. ***Feature Extraction***: Identifying key features or patterns within the image, such as edges, corners, lines, shapes, or textures.
4. ***Image Segmentation*** : Dividing the image into meaningful regions or segments based on similar features. 
5. ***Object Detection*** : Identifying and localizing specific objects within the image. 
6. ***Object Classification*** : Categorizing identified objects into predefined classes. 
7. ***Decision Making or Analysis*** : Using extracted information to perform an action or make decisions.
8. ***Output or Visualization :*** Displaying results or acting on the processed information.

## CV Applications :

- ***Augmented Reality*** (combines virtual objects with the real world)
- ***Autnomous Vehicles*** (interpret their surroundings by detecting objects like cars, pedestrians, traffic signs, and lanes)
- ***Facial Recognition*** (used in security systems, unlocking devices, and tagging people inphotos)
- ***Super-resolution imaging*** (enhances the quality of low-resolutionimages by reconstructing details, making them clearer and sharper)
- ***Optical Character Recognition (OCR)***  (extracts text fromimages or scanned documents.)
- ***Healthcare*** (analyzing medical images like X-rays, MRIs, or CT scans to detect diseases, monitor patient progress, and support diagnosis.)

Libraries : OpenCV, TensorFlow, SimpleCV, Caffe, PyTorch, Keras, Detectorn.
