### **Transactional Writes**

**Definition**:  
**Transactional writes** are write operations executed as part of a **transaction**. A transaction is a sequence of operations that must either succeed completely or fail entirely. This ensures data consistency and integrity in systems, even in the face of failures.

---

### **Key Properties of Transactions**

Transactional writes adhere to the **ACID principles** to maintain reliability:

1. **Atomicity**:
    
    - All operations in the transaction succeed or none are applied.
    - Example: If a bank transaction involves deducting money from one account and adding it to another, either both operations occur, or neither happens.
2. **Consistency**:
    
    - The system transitions from one valid state to another valid state after a transaction.
    - Example: The sum of all balances before and after the transaction remains the same.
3. **Isolation**:
    
    - Transactions do not interfere with each other, even if they occur simultaneously.
    - Example: Two users accessing the same database don’t see partial changes made by each other during their transactions.
4. **Durability**:
    
    - Once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanently saved, even in the event of a crash or failure.
    - Example: After writing to a database, the data is stored on durable storage like a disk.

### **Why Use Transactional Writes?**

1. **Data Integrity**:
    - Ensures no partial or corrupted updates occur, especially in distributed or concurrent systems.
2. **Fault Tolerance**:
    - Handles crashes or errors gracefully by rolling back incomplete writes.
3. **Concurrency Control**:
    - Multiple users can safely interact with the database without causing conflicts or inconsistencies.

---

### **Examples of Transactional Writes**

1. **Databases**:
    
    - **Relational Databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)**:
        - Example: Transferring money between accounts involves two writes:
            - Deducting from account A.
            - Adding to account B.
            - If one write fails, the entire transaction is rolled back.
    - **NoSQL Databases**:
        - Some databases like **MongoDB** and **Cassandra** also support transactional writes for multi-document or multi-record operations.
2. **Event Processing**:
    
    - Writing a message to a stream (e.g., Kafka) and updating a database can be part of a single transaction to ensure consistency.
3. **E-commerce**:
    
    - Updating inventory and recording a payment in an order management system is done using transactional writes to prevent overselling.

---

### **How Are Transactional Writes Implemented?**

1. **Two-Phase Commit (2PC)**:
    
    - A protocol to ensure distributed transactions are either fully committed or fully rolled back.
    - Example: Used in distributed databases.
2. **Optimistic Concurrency Control**:
    
    - Before committing, the system checks if data has been modified by another transaction. If not, the transaction succeeds.
3. **Database Locks**:
    
    - Locks are used to ensure isolation by preventing other transactions from modifying the same data until the current transaction is complete.

### **Difference Between Idempotent and Transactional Writes**

|**Aspect**|**Idempotent Writes**|**Transactional Writes**|
|---|---|---|
|**Definition**|Ensures repeated writes don't change the result|Ensures all operations in a transaction succeed or fail together.|
|**Purpose**|Handles retries gracefully in distributed systems.|Maintains data integrity and consistency.|
|**Scope**|Focuses on individual writes.|Focuses on a sequence of operations.|
|**Example**|Repeatedly writing `x = 42` has no extra effect.|Transferring money between two accounts.|

# **==Components of Transactional Writes==**
## **1. Two-Phase Commit (2PC)**

### **Definition**

Two-Phase Commit (**2PC**) is a **distributed transaction protocol** that ensures all participants in a transaction either commit or roll back together. It's commonly used in **distributed databases** and **stream processing systems**.

### **How It Works (Phases of 2PC)**

It consists of **two phases** managed by a **coordinator**:

1. **Prepare Phase (Voting Phase)**
    
    - The **coordinator** asks all participating nodes (e.g., databases, message queues) whether they are ready to commit.
    - Each node:
        - Performs necessary checks.
        - Reserves resources.
        - Responds with **"Yes" (ready to commit)** or **"No" (unable to commit)**.
2. **Commit Phase (Execution Phase)**
    
    - If **all nodes say "Yes"**, the **coordinator sends a "Commit" command**, and each node finalizes the transaction.
    - If **any node says "No"**, the coordinator **sends a "Rollback" command**, undoing any changes made.

### **Example:**

Imagine booking a **hotel + flight** together:

- If **both reservations** succeed, the system commits.
- If **one fails** (e.g., flight unavailable), the system rolls back the entire booking.

### **Where It's Used**:

- **Databases (SQL, NoSQL)** – Ensuring distributed transactions maintain consistency.
- **Apache Flink, Kafka Streams** – Coordinating writes to external systems.
- **Payment systems** – Ensuring a transaction is only processed **once** across multiple services.

### **Limitations:**

- **Slow performance** in high-scale systems (since all nodes must respond).
- **Blocking nature** – If a node crashes before commit, it can lock the system.
- **Alternatives** – **Optimistic Concurrency Control** or **Saga Pattern** (used in microservices).

---

## **2. Checkpointing Integration**

### **Definition**

Checkpointing is a mechanism in **stream processing** that **saves the current state** of the system at regular intervals to ensure **fault tolerance**.

### **Why is it Needed?**

- **Recover from Failures** – If a stream processing job crashes, it can restart from the last checkpoint instead of losing all data.
- **Ensures Exactly-Once Processing** – Helps maintain data integrity.
- **Enables Stateful Processing** – Works with **stateful stream processing** (e.g., windowed aggregations).

### **How It Works in Flink (Example):**

1. A checkpoint is triggered **every few seconds**.
2. Flink writes the current state (e.g., counts, aggregations) to a **durable store** (e.g., **HDFS, S3, RocksDB**).
3. If a failure occurs, Flink **restores from the last checkpoint**.

### **Example Use Case**:

- A **fraud detection system** processing millions of transactions.
- If the system crashes at **10:05 AM**, it **resumes from the last checkpoint (e.g., 10:04 AM)** instead of starting from scratch.

### **Where It’s Used:**

- **Apache Flink, Spark Streaming** – Handling large-scale real-time processing.
- **Kafka Streams** – Saves offsets to ensure messages are reprocessed correctly.

---

## **3. Transactional Sinks**

### **Definition**

A **transactional sink** ensures that data written to an **external system** (e.g., a database, Kafka, S3) is **atomic, consistent, and fault-tolerant**.

### **Why Do We Need It?**

- Prevents **duplicate writes** (exactly-once semantics).
- Ensures **atomic writes**—data is either fully written or not at all.
- Works **with checkpointing** to provide failure recovery.

### **How It Works in Flink (Example):**

1. **Pre-commit Stage**:
    - Data is staged but not visible to consumers yet.
2. **Checkpointing Syncs Data**:
    - If the checkpoint **succeeds**, the data is made **visible** (committed).
    - If the checkpoint **fails**, the write is **rolled back** to prevent partial writes.

### **Example:**

Imagine writing **real-time stock prices** from Flink to a database:

- If Flink crashes **before committing**, no partial stock updates appear in the DB.
- If it **recovers from a checkpoint**, it reprocesses only the missing data.

### **Where It’s Used:**

- **Flink + Kafka Transactional Producers** (ensures messages are committed only if successful).
- **Flink + Database (e.g., PostgreSQL, Cassandra)** (ensures consistent writes).
- **Event-driven architectures** (avoids duplicate or partial event consumption).

## Usecases of Transactional Writes :

- Writing aggregated financial data to a database with exactly-once guarantees
- Ensuring consistency in message delivery to Apache Kafka 
- Building fault-tolerant ETL pipelines

## Enabling Transactional Writes – Flink :

- Requires a sink that supports transactional writes 
- Flink ensures that the transaction is committed only after successful checkpointing


## Transactional Writes – Advantages :

- Guarantees data integrity in distributed systems.
- Ensures idempotent writes by avoiding duplicate or partial writes.
- Facilitates fault-tolerant systems by tying transactions to checkpoints.

## Transactional Writes – Challenges :

- Adds latency due to the overhead of managing transactions. 
- Requires sinks that explicitly support transactional semantics. 
- Debugging issues in distributed systems with transactional sinks can be complex.
