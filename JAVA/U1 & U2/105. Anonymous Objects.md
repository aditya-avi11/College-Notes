Nameless / Anonymous object: 
- An anonymous object in Java is an object that is instantiated without being assigned to a reference variable. 
- It is typically used when the object is needed only once, and therefore, no need to store a reference to it for later use. 
- Example: new Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2021).displayCarDetails(); The scope of an anonymous object is limited to the statement in which it is created. (because it has no reference)

```Java
import java.io.*; 

class Person { 
	String name; 
	int age; 

	Person(String name, int age) 
	{ 
		this.name = name; 
		this.age = age; 
	} 

	void display() 
	{ 
		System.out.println("Name: " + name 
						+ ", Age: " + age); 
	} 
} 

public class Main { 
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{ 
		// Create an anonymous object 
		// and call its display method 
		new Person("John", 30).display(); 
	} 
}
```

## Passing object as a parameter : 

```Java
class ComplexNumber {
    double real;
    double imaginary;

    // Constructor to initialize real and imaginary parts
    ComplexNumber(double real, double imaginary) {
        this.real = real;
        this.imaginary = imaginary;
    }

    // Method to add two complex numbers
    ComplexNumber add(ComplexNumber other) {
        double newReal = this.real + other.real;           // Adding real parts
        double newImaginary = this.imaginary + other.imaginary; // Adding imaginary parts
        return new ComplexNumber(newReal, newImaginary);   // Returning the result as a new ComplexNumber object
    }

    // Method to display the complex number
    void display() {
        System.out.println(real + " + " + imaginary + "i");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating two complex numbers
        ComplexNumber c1 = new ComplexNumber(3, 4);
        ComplexNumber c2 = new ComplexNumber(1, 2);

        // Adding the two complex numbers
        ComplexNumber result = c1.add(c2);

        // Displaying the result
        result.display();
    }
}
```

#### How this Works in the Code:
When you call c1.add(c2):

The this keyword inside the add method refers to c1 (the object on which the add method was invoked).
other refers to c2 (the object passed as an argument).
this.real refers to the real field of c1, while other.real refers to the real field of c2.

The result is calculated using:

this.real + other.real = 3 + 1 = 4
this.imaginary + other.imaginary = 4 + 2 = 6
A new ComplexNumber object is created with these values and returned.

Why Use this?
To avoid ambiguity when parameter names shadow instance variables.
To clarify that the variable belongs to the current object.
To pass the current object as an argument to another method or constructor.
In this code, while thereâ€™s no shadowing of variables, using this makes it clear that real and imaginary refer to the instance variables of the current object.
