### **Threads in Java**

A thread in Java is a lightweight subprocess, a smallest unit of processing. Threads allow a program to perform multiple tasks concurrently. The Java `Thread` class and `Runnable` interface in the `java.lang` package are used to create and manage threads.

#### **Key Characteristics of Threads:**

1. **Independent Execution**: Threads run independently of each other.
2. **Shared Memory**: Threads of the same process share memory and resources.
3. **Lifecycle**: A thread has a lifecycle that includes stages like New, Runnable, Running, Blocked, and Terminated.
4. **Multitasking**: Threads enable multitasking within a program.

### **Ways to Create Threads in Java (only first 2 are main)**

#### **1. ==Extending the `Thread` Class**==

- You can create a new thread by subclassing the `Thread` class and overriding its `run()` method.
- The `run()` method contains the code to be executed by the thread.
- Steps :
	• Create a new class that inherits from the Thread class.  
	• Override the run() method with the code that defines the task to be executed by the thread.
	• Create an instance of your class.  
	• Call the start() method on the instance to begin the execution of the thread.

**Example:**

```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}

public class ThreadExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread thread = new MyThread();
        thread.start(); // Starts the thread and invokes the run() method
    }
}
```

---

#### **2. ==Implementing the `Runnable` Interface**==

- Another way to create a thread is by implementing the `Runnable` interface and defining the `run()` method.
- You need to pass an instance of the class implementing `Runnable` to a `Thread` object.

**Example:**

```java
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}

public class ThreadExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyRunnable runnable = new MyRunnable();
        Thread thread = new Thread(runnable);
        thread.start(); // Starts the thread and invokes the run() method
    }
}
```

>[!Note]
>Comparing the Two Methods :
>
>Extending Thread Class 
>Pros: 
>• Simple to use. 
>• Direct access to thread methods. 
>Cons: 
>• Since Java does not support multiple inheritance, the class cannot extend any other class if it already extends Thread.
>
>Implementing Runnable Interface 
>Pros: 
>• More flexible, as the class can implement multiple interfaces. 
>• Better separation of task (runnable) and thread management.
> • Encourages reusability of the task logic with different threading frameworks. 
> Cons: 
> • Slightly more verbose than extending Thread.

#### **3. Using Anonymous Classes**

- You can create a thread using an anonymous class that extends `Thread` or implements `Runnable`.

**Example (Extending Thread):**

```java
public class ThreadExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread = new Thread() {
            @Override
            public void run() {
                System.out.println("Thread is running: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
            }
        };
        thread.start();
    }
}
```

**Example (Implementing Runnable):**

```java
public class ThreadExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread = new Thread(new Runnable() {
            @Override
            public void run() {
                System.out.println("Thread is running: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
            }
        });
        thread.start();
    }
}
```

#### **4. Using Lambda Expressions**

- If you are using Java 8 or later, you can use lambda expressions to simplify the creation of threads.

**Example:**

```java
public class ThreadExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {
            System.out.println("Thread is running: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
        });
        thread.start();
    }
}
```

---

#### **5. Using the `ExecutorService` Framework**

- The `ExecutorService` framework provides a way to manage a pool of threads for executing tasks.

**Example:**

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class ThreadExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);

        Runnable task1 = () -> System.out.println("Task 1 running: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
        Runnable task2 = () -> System.out.println("Task 2 running: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());

        executor.submit(task1);
        executor.submit(task2);

        executor.shutdown(); // Gracefully shuts down the executor
    }
}
```

### **Key Methods of the `Thread` Class**

- **`start()`**: Starts the execution of the thread. The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) calls the run() method of the thread.
- **`run()`**: Contains the code to be executed by the thread. This method should be overridden by any class that extends Thread.
- **`sleep(long millis)`**: Causes the current thread to sleep for a specified time.
- **`join()`**: Waits for a thread to die. If called on a thread, the calling thread will wait until the specified thread terminates.
- **`isAlive()`**: Checks if a thread is alive. 
- **`setPriority(int priority)`**: Sets the priority of a thread.
- `interrupt():` Interrupts the thread. If the thread is in a blocked state (such as sleeping or waiting), it will throw an InterruptedException.
- `setName(String name) and getName():` Sets or gets the name of the thread.

# Synchronized Threads

- Using threads effectively involves understanding thread synchronization, managing shared resources, and avoiding concurrency issues like deadlocks and race conditions.
- Synchronization in Java is a mechanism that ensures that only one thread can access a shared resource at a time. It is essential in multithreaded applications to prevent data inconsistency and ensure the correctness of the program.

Here’s an explanation of each key method in the `Thread` class:

---

### **1. `start()`**

- **Description**: This method starts the execution of a thread. When you call `start()`, the JVM creates a new thread and executes the `run()` method of the `Thread` object or the `Runnable` it is associated with.
- **Key Point**: Never call `run()` directly; it doesn’t create a new thread but executes the `run()` method in the current thread.

**Example:**

```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}

public class StartExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread thread = new MyThread();
        thread.start(); // Creates and starts a new thread
    }
}
```

---

### **2. `run()`**

- **Description**: The `run()` method contains the code that is executed when a thread starts. You must override this method when extending the `Thread` class or implementing the `Runnable` interface.
- **Key Point**: If you directly call `run()`, it will execute on the same thread instead of creating a new one.

**Example:**

```java
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Running in thread: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}

public class RunExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
        thread.start(); // Invokes the run() method in a new thread
    }
}
```

---

### **3. `sleep(long millis)`**

- **Description**: This method pauses the execution of the current thread for the specified number of milliseconds, allowing other threads to execute.
- **Throws**: `InterruptedException` if another thread interrupts the sleeping thread.
- **Key Point**: `sleep()` only pauses the thread temporarily; it doesn’t release any locks held by the thread.

**Example:**

```java
public class SleepExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {
            try {
                System.out.println("Thread sleeping...");
                Thread.sleep(2000); // Sleep for 2 seconds
                System.out.println("Thread awake!");
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                System.out.println("Thread interrupted!");
            }
        });

        thread.start();
    }
}
```

---

### **4. `join()`**

- **Description**: The `join()` method pauses the execution of the current thread until the specified thread finishes its execution.
- **Usage**: It ensures that a thread completes before another thread continues.
- **Throws**: `InterruptedException` if the current thread is interrupted while waiting.

**Example:**

```java
public class JoinExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {
            System.out.println("Thread running...");
            try {
                Thread.sleep(2000);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                System.out.println("Thread interrupted!");
            }
            System.out.println("Thread finished.");
        });

        thread.start();

        try {
            thread.join(); // Waits for the thread to finish
            System.out.println("Main thread resumes after child thread finishes.");
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            System.out.println("Main thread interrupted!");
        }
    }
}
```

---

### **5. `isAlive()`**

- **Description**: This method checks if a thread is still running. It returns `true` if the thread is alive (i.e., it has started but has not yet terminated).
- **Key Point**: A thread is considered alive after `start()` is called and before its `run()` method completes.

**Example:**

```java
public class IsAliveExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {
            try {
                Thread.sleep(1000); // Simulate work
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                System.out.println("Thread interrupted!");
            }
            System.out.println("Thread finished.");
        });

        thread.start();

        System.out.println("Is thread alive? " + thread.isAlive());
        try {
            Thread.sleep(1500); // Wait for thread to finish
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            System.out.println("Main thread interrupted!");
        }
        System.out.println("Is thread alive? " + thread.isAlive());
    }
}
```

---

### **6. `setPriority(int priority)`**

- **Description**: This method sets the priority of a thread. Thread priorities are used by the thread scheduler to decide the order of thread execution.
- **Range**: Priority values range from `Thread.MIN_PRIORITY` (1) to `Thread.MAX_PRIORITY` (10), with `Thread.NORM_PRIORITY` (5) as the default.
- **Key Point**: The priority only serves as a hint to the scheduler; it doesn’t guarantee execution order.

**Example:**

```java
public class PriorityExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(() -> System.out.println("Thread 1 running."));
        Thread thread2 = new Thread(() -> System.out.println("Thread 2 running."));

        thread1.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY); // Set high priority
        thread2.setPriority(Thread.MIN_PRIORITY); // Set low priority

        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
    }
}
```

### Summary

- **`start()`**: Starts a thread.
- **`run()`**: Defines the task for the thread.
- **`sleep()`**: Temporarily halts the thread for a specific time.
- **`join()`**: Waits for another thread to finish.
- **`isAlive()`**: Checks if the thread is still running.
- **`setPriority()`**: Suggests execution priority to the thread scheduler.

These methods allow developers to control and synchronize thread behavior in Java applications effectively.
