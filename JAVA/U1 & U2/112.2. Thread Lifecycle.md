A thread in Java at any point of time exists in any one of the following states. A thread lies only in one of the shown states at any instant: 
1. New State 
2. Runnable State 
3. Blocked State 
4. Waiting State 
5. Timed Waiting State 
6. Terminated State

1. New: Whenever a new thread is created, it is always in the new state. For a thread in the new state, the code has not been run yet and thus has not begun its execution. 
2. Active: When a thread invokes the start() method, it moves from the new state to the active state.
3. Runnable: A thread, that is ready to run is then moved to the runnable state. In the runnable state, the thread may be running or may be ready to run at any given instant of time. It is the duty of the thread scheduler to provide the thread time to run, i.e., moving the thread to the running state.
4. Running: When the thread gets the CPU, it moves from the runnable to the running state.
5. Blocked: The thread will be in blocked state when it is trying to acquire a lock but currently the lock is acquired by the other thread. The thread will move from the blocked state to runnable state when it acquires the lock. 
6. Waiting state: The thread will be in waiting state when it calls wait() method or join() method. It will move to the runnable state when other thread will notify or that thread will be terminated.
7. Timed Waiting: Sometimes, waiting leads to starvation. For example, a thread (A) has entered the critical section of a code and is not willing to leave that critical section. In such a scenario, another thread (B) has to wait forever, which leads to starvation. To avoid such scenario, a timed waiting state is given to thread B. Thus, thread lies in the waiting state for a specific span of time, and not forever. A real example of timed waiting is when we invoke the sleep() method on a specific thread. The sleep() method puts the thread in the timed wait state. After the time runs out, the thread wakes up and start its execution from when it has left earlier.
