The **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)** is the engine that provides Java's "Write Once, Run Anywhere" capability by abstracting the underlying hardware and operating system. It is responsible for executing Java bytecode.

### **JVM Architecture Components**

The JVM consists of several key components:

#### **1. Classloader**

- Responsible for loading `.class` files into the JVM.
- Converts bytecode into classes and makes them available to the execution engine.
- Uses three main mechanisms:
    - **Bootstrap Classloader**: Loads core Java classes (e.g., `java.lang`, `java.util`).
    - **Extension Classloader**: Loads classes from the `ext` directory.
    - **Application Classloader**: Loads classes from the application's classpath.

---

#### **2. Runtime Data Areas**

The JVM divides memory into different areas to manage and execute programs efficiently.

1. **Method Area**:
    
    - Stores ==class-level data== such as class structures, method code, static variables, and runtime constant pool.
    - Shared across all threads.
2. **Heap**:
    
    - Used to allocate memory for objects and their instance variables.
    - Garbage Collection manages this area.
    - This is the runtime data area from which memory for all class instances and arrays is allocated.
3. **Stack**:
    
    - Each thread has its own stack, which stores method-specific values such as:
        - Local variables.
        - Operand stacks.
        - Intermediate results.
    - Follows a **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** structure.
    - Stack: Whenever a new thread is created in the JVM, a separate runtime stack is also created at the same time. All local variables, method calls, and partial results are stored in the stack area.
4. **Program Counter (PC) Register**:
    
    - Each thread has a PC register that holds the address of the next instruction to be executed.
    - The JVM supports multiple threads at the same time. Each thread has its own PC Register to hold the address of the currently executing JVM instruction. Once the instruction is executed, the PC register is updated with the next instruction.
5. **Native Method Stack**:
    
    - Stores information for native methods (written in languages like C or C++) invoked by Java.

---

#### **3. Execution Engine**

- Once the bytecode has been loaded into the main memory, and details are available in the runtime data area, the next step is to run the program. 
- The Execution Engine handles this by executing the code present in each class. 
- However, before executing the program, the bytecode needs to be converted into machine language instructions. 
- The JVM can use an interpreter or a JIT compiler for the execution engine.
- The core component that executes bytecode.

6. **Interpreter**:
    
    - Reads and executes bytecode line-by-line.
    - Simple but slower due to repetitive method calls.
7. **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compiler**:
    
    - Converts frequently executed bytecode into ==native machine code== for faster execution.
    - Optimizations like **inlining** and **loop unrolling** improve performance.
8. **Garbage Collector (GC)**:
    
    - Automatically manages memory by reclaiming unused objects in the heap.
    - Performs tasks like marking reachable objects and sweeping away unreachable ones.

---

#### **4. Native Method Interface (JNI)**

- Facilitates interaction between Java code and native libraries written in other languages (e.g., C/C++).
- Allows the JVM to execute platform-specific tasks.

---

#### **5. Native Libraries**

- Contains libraries required by the JVM to execute native methods.
- These are platform-specific (e.g., `.dll` for Windows, `.so` for Linux).

---

### **Workflow of JVM**

9. The **classloader** loads `.class` files into memory.
10. The **bytecode verifier** checks the bytecode for security and validity.
11. The **interpreter** or **JIT compiler** converts bytecode into machine code.
12. The **execution engine** executes the code, using data from the runtime data areas.
13. The **garbage collector** cleans up memory by removing unused objects.
