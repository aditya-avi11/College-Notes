### **Abstract Class in Java**

An **abstract class** in Java is a class that is declared with the `abstract` keyword. It can have both **abstract methods** (methods without a body) and **concrete methods** (methods with a body). Abstract classes are designed to be extended by subclasses, which must implement the abstract methods.

---

### **Key Features of Abstract Classes**

1. **Cannot be instantiated**: You cannot create objects of an abstract class directly.
2. **Can have abstract and concrete methods**:
    - Abstract methods have no implementation and are declared with the `abstract` keyword.
    - Concrete methods have a body and provide default behavior that can be inherited or overridden.
3. **Can have constructors**: Abstract classes can define constructors, which are called when a subclass object is created.
4. **Supports instance variables**: Abstract classes can have fields, which subclasses inherit.
5. **Purpose**: **They are used when you want to provide a common base with some default behavior while ensuring certain methods are implemented by subclasses.**

---

### **Syntax**

```java
abstract class AbstractClass {
    // Abstract method (no body)
    abstract void abstractMethod();

    // Concrete method (has a body)
    void concreteMethod() {
        System.out.println("This is a concrete method.");
    }
}
```

---

### **Example of Abstract Class**

```java
abstract class Animal {
    // Abstract method
    abstract void makeSound();

    // Concrete method
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    // Implementing abstract method
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("The dog barks.");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    // Implementing abstract method
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("The cat meows.");
    }
}

public class AbstractExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal dog = new Dog();
        dog.makeSound(); // Outputs: The dog barks.
        dog.eat();       // Outputs: This animal eats food.

        Animal cat = new Cat();
        cat.makeSound(); // Outputs: The cat meows.
        cat.eat();       // Outputs: This animal eats food.
    }
}
```

Example: Abstract Class with Instance Variables
```Java
abstract class Animal {
    String name = "Unknown";  // Instance variable
    int age = 0;

    abstract void makeSound(); // Abstract method (must be overridden)
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    Dog() {
        name = "Dog";
        age = 3;
    }

    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println(name + " barks!");
    }
}

public class AbstractVariableExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        System.out.println("Name: " + dog.name); // Access instance variable
        System.out.println("Age: " + dog.age);
        dog.makeSound();
    }
}
```

Example: Abstract Class with Constructor
```Java
abstract class Vehicle {
    String type;

    // Constructor in abstract class
    Vehicle(String type) {
        this.type = type;
        System.out.println("Vehicle Constructor: " + type);
    }

    abstract void start();
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    String brand;

    Car(String brand) {
        super("Car");  // Call abstract class constructor
        this.brand = brand;
    }

    void start() {
        System.out.println(brand + " is starting!");
    }
}

public class AbstractConstructorExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car = new Car("Toyota");  // Creates an object of Car
        car.start();
    }
}
```

---

### **Key Points**

1. The **abstract class `Animal`** provides a common base.
2. The **abstract method `makeSound()`** must be implemented by all subclasses (`Dog` and `Cat`).
3. The **concrete method `eat()`** is inherited by subclasses and can be used as-is.

---

### **Use Cases**

1. **Common Behavior with Custom Implementations**:
    - Abstract classes define a template for subclasses, enforcing implementation of certain methods.
2. **Polymorphism**:
    - Abstract classes allow working with a common type while using specific subclass implementations.

---

### **Difference Between Abstract Class and Interface**

|**Feature**|**Abstract Class**|**Interface**|
|---|---|---|
|Declaration|Use `abstract` keyword.|Use `interface` keyword.|
|Methods|Can have both abstract and concrete methods.|Can have abstract methods (and default/static methods in Java 8+).|
|Fields|Can have instance variables and constants.|Can only have constants (static final fields).|
|Multiple Inheritance|A class can inherit only one abstract class.|A class can implement multiple interfaces.|
|Constructors|Can have constructors.|Cannot have constructors.|

---

### **Abstract Class vs Concrete Class**

|**Feature**|**Abstract Class**|**Concrete Class**|
|---|---|---|
|Instantiation|Cannot be instantiated.|Can be instantiated.|
|Purpose|Provides a template for subclasses.|Provides a complete implementation.|
|Abstract Methods|May have abstract methods.|Cannot have abstract methods.|

---

### **When to Use Abstract Class**

1. Use an **abstract class** when there is a clear hierarchy, and you want to enforce a common set of behaviors across all subclasses while allowing some shared implementation.
2. If you need to provide shared code or instance variables for subclasses, an abstract class is a good choice.

# ***Interfaces in Java***

An **interface** in Java is a reference type that is similar to a class but is used to specify a contract (set of methods) that a class must implement. It is declared using the `interface` keyword and is a blueprint for a class. Interfaces are widely used to achieve **abstraction** and **multiple inheritance** in Java.

---

### **Key Features of Interfaces**

1. **Contains abstract methods by default**: All methods in an interface are implicitly public and abstract (until Java 8, which added default and static methods).
2. **Cannot have instance variables**: Interfaces can only have constants (static final variables).
3. **Achieves multiple inheritance**: A class can implement multiple interfaces, allowing Java to support multiple inheritance.
4. **Cannot be instantiated**: Interfaces cannot be used to create objects directly.
5. **Provides a contract**: Classes that implement an interface must provide implementations for all its abstract methods.

---

### **Syntax**

```java
interface InterfaceName {
    // Abstract method
    void method1();
    
    // Default method (introduced in Java 8)
    default void method2() {
        System.out.println("Default method in interface.");
    }
    
    // Static method (introduced in Java 8)
    static void method3() {
        System.out.println("Static method in interface.");
    }
}
```

---

### **Example: Interface in Action**

```java
interface Animal {
    void makeSound(); // Abstract method

    // Default method
    default void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
    }
}

class Dog implements Animal {
    @Override
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("The dog barks.");
    }
}

class Cat implements Animal {
    @Override
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("The cat meows.");
    }
}

public class InterfaceExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal dog = new Dog();
        dog.makeSound(); // Outputs: The dog barks.
        dog.eat();       // Outputs: This animal eats food.

        Animal cat = new Cat();
        cat.makeSound(); // Outputs: The cat meows.
        cat.eat();       // Outputs: This animal eats food.
    }
}
```

### **Interface vs Abstract Class**

|**Feature**|**Interface**|**Abstract Class**|
|---|---|---|
|Declaration|Use `interface` keyword.|Use `abstract` keyword.|
|Methods|Can only have abstract, default, or static methods.|Can have both abstract and concrete methods.|
|Variables|Can only have static final constants.|Can have instance variables.|
|Multiple Inheritance|A class can implement multiple interfaces.|A class can inherit only one abstract class.|
|Constructors|Cannot have constructors.|Can have constructors.|

---

## ***Default and Static Methods in Interfaces***

Since **Java 8**, interfaces can have:

1. **Default methods**:
    - Provide a default implementation that can be inherited by classes.
    - Useful for adding new functionality to interfaces without breaking existing code.
2. **Static methods**:
    - Belong to the interface and cannot be overridden by classes.

#### Example:

```java
interface Shape {
    void draw(); // Abstract method

    // Default method
    default void description() {
        System.out.println("This is a shape.");
    }

    // Static method
    static void info() {
        System.out.println("Static method in Shape interface.");
    }
}

class Circle implements Shape {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a circle.");
    }
}

public class InterfaceMethodsExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape circle = new Circle();
        circle.draw();            // Outputs: Drawing a circle.
        circle.description();     // Outputs: This is a shape.
        Shape.info();             // Outputs: Static method in Shape interface.
    }
}
```

### **When to Use Interfaces**

- Use **interfaces** when you need to define a common behavior for unrelated classes.
- Use **interfaces** when you want to take advantage of multiple inheritance.

### **Why Do We Need Abstract Classes and Interfaces in Java?**

Java is an **object-oriented programming language** that heavily relies on inheritance and polymorphism. To design flexible and reusable systems, we often need a way to:

1. **Enforce a contract**: Ensure certain methods are implemented in a class.
2. **Achieve abstraction**: Provide a blueprint for future classes without providing full implementations.
3. **Facilitate polymorphism**: Use a common reference type for objects of different classes.

Both **abstract classes** and **interfaces** serve these purposes but are used in different scenarios. Understanding their differences helps in designing a better application architecture.

---

### **Need for Abstract Classes**

1. **Partial Implementation**: Abstract classes allow you to define both **abstract methods** (no body) and **concrete methods** (with body). This is useful when you want to provide some base functionality that subclasses can inherit.
2. **Code Reusability**: Common logic can be shared among subclasses.
3. **Inheritance**: Used when there is a strong "is-a" relationship. For example, `Bird` is an `Animal`.

---

### **Need for Interfaces**

1. **Multiple Inheritance**: Since Java doesn't allow multiple inheritance with classes, interfaces are used to achieve it.
2. **Pure Abstraction**: Interfaces define a contract that classes must follow but donâ€™t provide any implementation (prior to Java 8).
3. **Unrelated Classes**: Used when unrelated classes need to share a common behavior. For example, `Dog` and `Car` can both implement `Movable`.

---

### **Differences Between Abstract Classes and Interfaces**

|**Feature**|**Abstract Class**|**Interface**|
|---|---|---|
|**Nature**|Can have both abstract and concrete methods.|Prior to Java 8, only abstract methods were allowed. From Java 8, default and static methods are supported.|
|**Inheritance**|A class can inherit only one abstract class.|A class can implement multiple interfaces.|
|**Use Case**|Used for closely related classes with common logic.|Used to define contracts for unrelated classes.|
|**Constructors**|Can have constructors.|Cannot have constructors.|
|**Variables**|Can have instance variables.|Can only have `public static final` constants.|
|**Speed**|Slightly faster because of fewer levels of abstraction.|Slightly slower due to additional indirection.|

---

### **Examples**

#### **Abstract Class Example**

```java
abstract class Animal {
    String name;

    Animal(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    // Abstract method (no implementation)
    abstract void makeSound();

    // Concrete method (implementation provided)
    void eat() {
        System.out.println(name + " is eating.");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    Dog(String name) {
        super(name);
    }

    @Override
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println(name + " says Woof!");
    }
}

class AbstractClassDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal dog = new Dog("Buddy");
        dog.makeSound(); // Outputs: Buddy says Woof!
        dog.eat();       // Outputs: Buddy is eating.
    }
}
```

#### **Interface Example**

```java
interface Movable {
    void move(); // Abstract method
}

interface Stoppable {
    void stop(); // Abstract method
}

class Car implements Movable, Stoppable {
    @Override
    public void move() {
        System.out.println("The car is moving.");
    }

    @Override
    public void stop() {
        System.out.println("The car has stopped.");
    }
}

class InterfaceDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car = new Car();
        car.move(); // Outputs: The car is moving.
        car.stop(); // Outputs: The car has stopped.
    }
}
```

---

### **When to Use What?**

- **Abstract Classes**:
    
    - Use when classes share common functionality or properties.
    - Example: `Animal`, `Vehicle`.
- **Interfaces**:
    
    - Use when you want unrelated classes to implement the same behavior.
    - Example: `Serializable`, `Comparable`, or custom behaviors like `Movable`.

#### **Hybrid Usage**

In real-world applications, it's common to use both:

1. Use an **abstract class** for shared properties and base behavior.
2. Use **interfaces** for adding specific capabilities.

---

#### **Example of Combined Usage**

```java
abstract class Shape {
    abstract void draw();
    void description() {
        System.out.println("This is a shape.");
    }
}

interface Colorable {
    void fillColor(String color);
}

class Circle extends Shape implements Colorable {
    @Override
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a Circle.");
    }

    @Override
    public void fillColor(String color) {
        System.out.println("Filling Circle with color: " + color);
    }
}

public class CombinedExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Circle circle = new Circle();
        circle.draw();           // Outputs: Drawing a Circle.
        circle.description();    // Outputs: This is a shape.
        circle.fillColor("Red"); // Outputs: Filling Circle with color: Red.
    }
}
```

By combining abstract classes and interfaces, you can leverage the strengths of both to create clean, modular, and reusable code. Let me know if youâ€™d like a deeper dive into any of these concepts! ðŸ˜Š
