### **Exception Handling in Java**

**Exception Handling** in Java is a mechanism to handle runtime errors, ensuring the program's normal flow. Exceptions are events that disrupt the normal execution of a program. Java provides a robust framework to handle exceptions and recover from them gracefully.

### **Key Concepts of Exception Handling**

#### 1. **Exceptions**

- ==**Checked Exceptions**==: Exceptions that are checked at compile time. Example: `IOException`, `SQLException, FileNotFoundException`. These exceptions must be either caught using a try-catch block or declared in the method signature using the throws keyword.

- ==**Unchecked Exceptions**== (runtime exceptions): Exceptions that are not checked at compile time, generally programming bugs, such as logic mistakes or improper use of an API. Example: `NullPointerException`, `ArithmeticException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. Unchecked exceptions are subclasses of RuntimeException and are **not required** to be declared in a method's throws clause or caught by a try-catch block.

- **==Errors==**: Serious issues that the program should not try to handle (e.g., `OutOfMemoryError`, `StackOverflowError, VirtualMachineError`). These exceptions must be either caught using a try-catch block or declared in the method signature using the throws keyword.

#### 2. **Hierarchy**

The `Throwable` class is the root of all exceptions and errors:

```
Throwable
â”œâ”€â”€ Exception (Recoverable)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Checked Exceptions
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Unchecked Exceptions (RuntimeException and its subclasses)
â””â”€â”€ Error (Unrecoverable)
```

### **Exception Handling Keywords**

1. **`try`**
    
    - Defines a block of code to monitor for exceptions.
    - If an exception occurs, it is passed to a `catch` block.
    
    ```java
    try {
        int result = 10 / 0; // ArithmeticException
    }
    ```
    
2. **`catch`**
    
    - Defines a block of code to handle specific exceptions.
    - Multiple `catch` blocks can be used for different exception types.
    
    ```java
    try {
        int result = 10 / 0;
    } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
        System.out.println("Cannot divide by zero.");
    }
    ```
    
3. **`finally`**
    
    - Defines a block of code that always executes, regardless of whether an exception occurred or was handled.
    - It is used for cleanup activities, such as closing files or releasing resources.
    
    ```java
    try {
        int result = 10 / 0;
    } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
        System.out.println("Exception handled.");
    } finally {
        System.out.println("Execution completed.");
    }
    ```
    
4. **`throw`**
    
    - Used to explicitly throw an exception.
    - It is typically used within a method to throw an exception.
    
    ```java
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid input");
    ```
    
5. **`throws`**
    
    - Declares exceptions that a method can throw.
    - This keyword is used in method signatures to declare that a method might throw one or more exceptions. It informs the caller of the method about the exceptions that might be thrown.
    
    ```java
    void readFile() throws IOException {
        throw new IOException("File not found");
    }
    ```

### **Basic Example**

```java
public class ExceptionHandlingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            int result = 10 / 0; // Will throw ArithmeticException
            System.out.println("Result: " + result);
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("Exception caught: " + e.getMessage());
        } finally {
            System.out.println("Finally block always executes.");
        }
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
Exception caught: / by zero
Finally block always executes.
```

### **Multiple Catch Blocks**

```java
public class MultipleCatchExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            String str = null;
            System.out.println(str.length()); // NullPointerException
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("Arithmetic Exception caught.");
        } catch (NullPointerException e) {
            System.out.println("Null Pointer Exception caught.");
        } finally {
            System.out.println("Finally block always executes.");
        }
    }
}
```

### **Custom Exceptions**

Custom exceptions can be created by extending the `Exception` class.

**Example**:

```java
class CustomException extends Exception {
    public CustomException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}

public class CustomExceptionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            validateAge(15);
        } catch (CustomException e) {
            System.out.println("Caught: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }

    static void validateAge(int age) throws CustomException {
        if (age < 18) {
            throw new CustomException("Age must be 18 or above.");
        }
    }
}
```

### **Exception Propagation**

Exceptions can propagate up the call stack if not handled at a lower level.

**Example**:

```java
public class ExceptionPropagation {
    static void method1() throws ArithmeticException {
        int result = 10 / 0; // Exception
    }

    static void method2() throws ArithmeticException {
        method1(); // Propagates exception
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            method2();
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("Exception handled in main.");
        }
    }
}
```

### **Difference Between Checked and Unchecked Exceptions**

|**Aspect**|**Checked Exceptions**|**Unchecked Exceptions**|
|---|---|---|
|**Compile-time Check**|Yes|No|
|**Examples**|`IOException`, `SQLException`|`NullPointerException`, `ArithmeticException`|
|**Use Case**|Anticipated issues like file not found|Programming bugs, logical errors|

---

### **Best Practices**

1. Always catch specific exceptions instead of a generic `Exception`.
2. Use `finally` to release resources like file handles or database connections.
3. Avoid overusing exceptions for regular control flow.
4. Log exceptions to understand issues during debugging.
