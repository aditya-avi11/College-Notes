# Inner Class 
- Inner classes in Java are classes that are defined within another class. 
- They are used to logically group classes that are only used in one place, increase encapsulation, and can lead to more readable and maintainable code. 
- Java supports four types of inner classes: 
1. **Member Inner Class** 
2. **Static Nested Class** 
3. **Local Inner Class** 
4. **Anonymous Inner Class**

### **Inner Classes in Java**

Inner classes are classes defined within the scope of another class. They are typically used to group related classes together for better encapsulation and organization. Since an inner class can directly access the fields and methods of its outer class, they are useful when the inner class is tightly coupled with the outer class.

### **Types of Inner Classes**

#### 1. **Member Inner Class**

- Defined directly inside a class but outside any method, constructor, or block.
- It is a non-static inner class and has access to all members (including private members) of the outer class.
- To instantiate, you need an instance of the outer class.

**Example**:

```java
class Outer {
    private String message = "Hello, Inner Class!";

    class MemberInner {
        void display() {
            System.out.println(message); // Accessing outer class private member
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Outer outer = new Outer();
        Outer.MemberInner inner = outer.new MemberInner();
        inner.display();
    }
}
```

#### 2. **Static Nested Class**

- Defined with the `static` keyword.
- Does not require an instance of the outer class to be instantiated.
- ==Can only access static members of the outer class.==

**Example**:

```java
class Outer {
    static String message = "Hello, Static Nested Class!";

    static class StaticNested {
        void display() {
            System.out.println(message); // Accessing static member of outer class
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Outer.StaticNested nested = new Outer.StaticNested();
        nested.display();
    }
}
```

---

#### 3. **Local Inner Class**

- Defined inside a method or block of code.
- Its scope is limited to the method or block in which it is declared.
- Can access the local variables of the method if they are declared as `final` (or effectively final in Java 8+).

**Example**:

```java
class Outer {
    void display() {
        final String message = "Hello, Local Inner Class!";

        class LocalInner {
            void print() {
                System.out.println(message); // Accessing local variable
            }
        }

        LocalInner localInner = new LocalInner();
        localInner.print();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Outer outer = new Outer();
        outer.display();
    }
}
```

#### 4. **Anonymous Inner Class**

- A class that does not have a name and is declared and instantiated in a single step.
- Typically used to provide a one-time implementation of an interface or abstract class.

**Example** (Anonymous class implementing an interface):

```java
interface Greeting {
    void sayHello();
}

class Outer {
    void display() {
        Greeting greeting = new Greeting() {
            public void sayHello() {
                System.out.println("Hello, Anonymous Inner Class!");
            }
        };
        greeting.sayHello();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Outer outer = new Outer();
        outer.display();
    }
}
```

**Example** (Anonymous class extending a class):

```java
class Parent {
    void display() {
        System.out.println("Parent Class");
    }
}

class Outer {
    void show() {
        Parent obj = new Parent() {
            void display() {
                System.out.println("Anonymous Inner Class Extending Parent");
            }
        };
        obj.display();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Outer outer = new Outer();
        outer.show();
    }
}
```

### **Key Differences Between Types of Inner Classes**

|**Feature**|**Member Inner Class**|**Static Nested Class**|**Local Inner Class**|**Anonymous Inner Class**|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Static**|No|Yes|No|No|
|**Access Outer Class**|Yes|Only static members|Yes (if final/effectively final)|Yes (via outer instance)|
|**Instantiation**|Requires outer class instance|No need for outer class instance|Limited to method/block scope|Created inline during declaration|
|**Use Case**|For tight coupling with outer class|Helper class for static context|Temporary logic in a method|One-time implementation|
