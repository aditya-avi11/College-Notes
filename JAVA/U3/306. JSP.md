# JSP ‚Äì Life cycle

1. ***==Translation Phase:==*** The JSP file is translated into a servlet by the JSP engine. This step involves converting the JSP file into a Java servlet source file. 
2. **==*Compilation Phase:*==** The generated servlet source file is compiled into a servlet class file. This step converts the Java source code into bytecode that can be executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
3. **==*Loading and Initialization Phase:*==** 
	- Loading: The servlet class is loaded into memory by the servlet container. 
	- Instantiation: An instance of the servlet is created.
	- Initialization (jspInit Method): The jspInit method is called to initialize the servlet. This method is called only once, when the servlet is first loaded.
4. **==*Request Handling Phase:*==** 
	- Request Processing (_jspService Method): The _jspService method is called to process each client request. This method is invoked for every request that the JSP receives. It handles the main logic of the JSP, including generating dynamic content and interacting with the server 3and database.
	- Response Generation: The output generated by the JSP is sent back to the client as an HTTP response.
5. **==*Destroy Phase (jspDestroy Method):*==** The jspDestroy method is called to clean up resources when the JSP is being taken out of service. This method is called only once, just before the servlet is destroyed.

## **JSP Elements in Java**

JavaServer Pages (**JSP**) provides different types of elements to insert **Java code, define logic, and display dynamic content** in web pages. The main JSP elements are:

1. **Directive Elements** (`<%@ %>`)
2. **Declaration Elements** (`<%! %>`)
3. **Scriptlet Elements** (`<% %>`)
4. **Expression Elements** (`<%= %>`)
5. **Action Elements** (`<jsp:...>`)
6. **Comment Elements** (`<%-- --%>`)

---

## ==**1Ô∏è‚É£== ==Directive Elements (`<%@ %>`)**==

Directives **provide instructions to the JSP engine** about how the page should be processed.

### **Types of Directives:**

- **Page Directive (`<%@ page ... %>`)** ‚Üí Defines page settings (e.g., importing packages, setting content type)
- **Include Directive (`<%@ include ... %>`)** ‚Üí Inserts another file at compilation time
- **Taglib Directive (`<%@ taglib ... %>`)** ‚Üí Enables use of custom JSP tags

### **Example: Page Directive**

```jsp
<%@ page language="java" contentType="text/html; charset=UTF-8" %>
<%@ page import="java.util.Date" %>
```

- `import="java.util.Date"` ‚Üí Allows using `Date` class in JSP.

### **Example: Include Directive**

```jsp
<%@ include file="header.jsp" %>
```

- Inserts `header.jsp` at **compile time** (static inclusion).

---

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Declaration Elements (`<%! %>`)**

Used to **declare methods and variables** that can be used in JSP.

### **Example:**

```jsp
<%! int count = 0; %>
<%! public String getMessage() { return "Hello, JSP!"; } %>
```

- **Variables (`count`)** are declared at **class level**.
- **Methods (`getMessage()`)** can be defined and called inside JSP.

---

## ==**3Ô∏è‚É£ Scriptlet Elements (`<% %>`)**==

Used to **write Java code inside JSP**.

### **Example:**

```jsp
<%
  int x = 10;
  out.println("Value of x: " + x);
%>
```

- Executes Java code inside the JSP page.
- **Not recommended in modern JSP (Use JSTL & EL instead).**

---

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Expression Elements (`<%= %>`)**

Used to **print values on the webpage**.

### **Example:**

```jsp
<%= "Today's Date: " + new java.util.Date() %>
```

Equivalent to:

```jsp
<%
out.println("Today's Date: " + new java.util.Date());
%>
```

- **Shorter and cleaner syntax for output**.

---

## ==**5Ô∏è‚É£ Action Elements (`<jsp:...>`)**==

JSP **action tags** are used to control the behavior of JSP pages.

### **Common JSP Actions:**

|Tag|Description|
|---|---|
|`<jsp:include>`|Includes another JSP **at runtime** (dynamic)|
|`<jsp:forward>`|Forwards request to another page|
|`<jsp:param>`|Passes parameters to another JSP|
|`<jsp:useBean>`|Creates a Java Bean object|
|`<jsp:setProperty>`|Sets a property in a Java Bean|
|`<jsp:getProperty>`|Retrieves a property from a Java Bean|

### **Example: `<jsp:include>`**

```jsp
<jsp:include page="footer.jsp"/>
```

- Dynamically includes `footer.jsp`.

### **Example: `<jsp:useBean>`**

```jsp
<jsp:useBean id="user" class="com.example.User" scope="session"/>
<jsp:setProperty name="user" property="name" value="John Doe"/>
<jsp:getProperty name="user" property="name"/>
```

- **Creates a JavaBean** (`User`).
- **Sets and gets properties** of the bean.

---

## **6Ô∏è‚É£ Comment Elements (`<%-- --%>`)**

Used for **comments inside JSP** (not visible in the browser).

### **Example:**

```jsp
<%-- This is a JSP comment. It won't appear in the HTML source. --%>
```

‚úÖ **JSP comments are not included in the client‚Äôs HTML source.**  
‚ùå HTML comments (`<!-- ... -->`) **are visible in the page source**.

---

## **üéØ Summary Table:**

|JSP Element|Syntax|Purpose|
|---|---|---|
|**Directive**|`<%@ %>`|Page settings (`page`, `include`, `taglib`)|
|**Declaration**|`<%! %>`|Define variables and methods|
|**Scriptlet**|`<% %>`|Java code execution|
|**Expression**|`<%= %>`|Output data directly|
|**Action Tag**|`<jsp:...>`|Perform actions (include, forward, beans)|
|**Comment**|`<%-- --%>`|Internal JSP comments|

---

## **üöÄ Best Practices for Modern JSP Development**

‚úÖ **Avoid using `<% %>` scriptlets**. Use **JSTL (JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library)** and **EL (Expression Language)** instead.  
‚úÖ **Use `<jsp:include>` instead of `<%@ include>`** for better flexibility.  
‚úÖ **Use MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern** by keeping logic in **Servlets or Beans**, not in JSP.
