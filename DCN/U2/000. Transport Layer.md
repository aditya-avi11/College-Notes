### Video Processing and Transport Layer

- **Video Processing**: Involves converting raw video into a format suitable for storage or transmission. This process includes compression (reducing the size of video files), transcoding (changing formats), and encoding (converting video into a streamable format). Common codecs used for compression include H.264, H.265, and VP9. Video processing ensures efficient transmission over networks.

- **Transport Layer**: Responsible for delivering data across the network reliably and efficiently. The transport layer ensures data integrity, error recovery, flow control, and congestion control, crucial for video streaming to provide a smooth viewing experience.

### Video Streaming and Content Distribution Networks (CDNs)

- **Video Streaming**: Delivers video content in real-time over the internet without requiring a full download. It involves splitting video files into smaller segments (chunks) and sending them sequentially. Streaming protocols like HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) and Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) are commonly used for adaptive bitrate streaming, adjusting video quality based on network conditions.

- **Content Distribution Networks (CDNs)**: CDNs improve video delivery by distributing video content across multiple servers in various geographical locations. CDNs minimize latency and reduce the load on the original server by caching content closer to the user, thus improving the streaming experience.

### Socket Programming – Creating Network Applications

- **Socket Programming**: A programming method that allows the creation of networked applications. Sockets are the endpoints of a communication link between two devices on a network. Developers use socket programming to create both **client** and **server** applications that communicate over TCP or UDP. Key functions include:
    - `socket()`: Creates a socket.
    - `bind()`: Associates a socket with an IP address and port.
    - `listen()` and `accept()`: For server sockets to wait for client connections.
    - `connect()`: For client sockets to initiate a connection.
    - `send()` and `recv()`: To transmit and receive data.

### Introduction and Transport Layer Services

- **Transport Layer Services**: The transport layer provides critical services for communication between processes running on different hosts. It ensures reliable and error-checked data transfer. The primary services include:
    - **Multiplexing and Demultiplexing**: Allows multiple applications to share the same network interface and IP address. Multiplexing involves combining data from different applications, while demultiplexing separates incoming data and directs it to the correct application.
    - **Error Detection and Correction**: Ensures data integrity during transmission by detecting and correcting errors.

### Connectionless Transport: UDP

- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**: A lightweight, connectionless protocol that provides minimal transport services. It is used for scenarios where low latency is more critical than reliability, such as live video streaming and gaming.
    - No connection setup required.
    - No error recovery, sequencing, or flow control.
    - Suitable for applications that can tolerate some data loss but need fast delivery.

### Principles of Reliable Data Transfer Protocols

- **Reliable Data Transfer (RDT)** protocols ensure that data is delivered accurately and in order over unreliable networks. The two main types of protocols are:
    - **Go-Back-N (GBN)**: A sliding window protocol where the sender can send several frames before needing an acknowledgment but must go back and retransmit all frames after a lost packet.
    - **Selective Repeat (SR)**: Also a sliding window protocol but more efficient than GBN. It allows only the lost packet to be retransmitted instead of the entire sequence.

### Connection-Oriented Transport: TCP

- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**: A reliable, connection-oriented protocol that ensures data is delivered accurately and in order.
    - **Connection Establishment**: Uses a three-way handshake to establish a reliable connection.
    - **Error Recovery**: Implements mechanisms like checksums, acknowledgments (ACKs), and retransmissions to recover from errors.
    - **Flow Control**: Ensures the sender does not overwhelm the receiver by adjusting the sending rate based on the receiver's capacity.
    - **Congestion Control**: Regulates traffic to prevent congestion in the network, ensuring data flows smoothly.
