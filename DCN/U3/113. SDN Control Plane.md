Here's a clear explanation of the concepts related to Software Defined Networking (SDN) based on your college notes:

### What is Software Defined Networking (SDN)?

**SDN** is a modern approach to networking that separates the **control plane** (which decides where data is sent) from the **data plane** (which forwards data to its destination). It gives centralized control over the network, making network management more efficient, flexible, and programmable.

### Traditional Networking vs. SDN:

1. **Traditional Networks**:
   - In a traditional network, each router independently computes its forwarding table using distributed routing algorithms (like OSPF or BGP).
   - Each router runs a proprietary OS (e.g., Cisco IOS) and is responsible for both the control plane and data plane.
   - Different specialized devices (middleboxes) handle different network functions (firewalls, NAT, load balancers).

2. **SDN Approach**:
   - **Centralized Control Plane**: Instead of each router independently computing its forwarding table, a **central controller** manages the forwarding decisions for the entire network.
   - **Control Agent (CA)** in each router communicates with the centralized controller, which installs the forwarding tables into the routers.

### Why Use a Logically Centralized Control Plane in SDN?

1. **Easier Network Management**: Centralized control prevents router misconfigurations and allows for flexible traffic control.
2. **Programmability**: With a central controller, you can "program" the forwarding tables, making it easier to adjust and optimize traffic.
3. **Open and Non-Proprietary**: SDN supports open protocols and implementations (e.g., OpenFlow), fostering innovation and removing the dependency on vendor-specific hardware.

### Key Components in SDN:

1. **Data-Plane Switches**:
   - These are fast, simple switches that forward packets based on precomputed flow tables installed by the SDN controller.
   - They communicate with the controller through an API (like OpenFlow) to receive instructions on how to handle packets.

2. **SDN Controller (Network OS)**:
   - Acts as the central “brain” of the network, maintaining the state of the network and computing the flow tables.
   - It interacts with:
     - **Northbound APIs** to communicate with higher-level control applications.
     - **Southbound APIs** to communicate with network devices (switches, routers).

3. **Network-Control Applications**:
   - These applications implement control logic, such as routing, load balancing, or security policies, using the SDN controller's services.
   - They are separate from the SDN controller and can be developed by third-party vendors, allowing for more modular and flexible networking solutions.

### OpenFlow Protocol in SDN:

**OpenFlow** is a key protocol used in SDN for communication between the controller and network switches. It allows the controller to manage the flow tables on switches and define how packets should be handled.

- **Controller-to-Switch Messages**:
   - **Features**: The controller queries the capabilities of a switch.
   - **Modify-State**: The controller adds, deletes, or modifies flow table entries.
   - **Packet-Out**: The controller sends a specific packet to a particular switch port.

- **Switch-to-Controller Messages**:
   - **Packet-In**: The switch sends a packet to the controller for further instructions.
   - **Flow-Removed**: Notifies the controller when a flow entry is deleted.
   - **Port Status**: Informs the controller about changes in switch ports.

### SDN vs. Traditional Protocol-Based Networks:

1. **Centralized (SDN) vs. Distributed (Traditional)**:
   - In SDN, forwarding tables and network control decisions are computed centrally by a controller.
   - In traditional networks, routing decisions are made using distributed algorithms where each router participates independently.

2. **Future of Traditional Protocols**:
   - SDN introduces new ways to implement network functionality (e.g., congestion control, load balancing) that could replace or complement traditional network protocols.
   - In an SDN environment, the controller can monitor network conditions and adjust routing or flow control dynamically based on real-time data.

### Summary:

Software Defined Networking (SDN) revolutionizes how networks are managed by centralizing the control plane, separating it from the data plane, and using open protocols like OpenFlow. This approach simplifies network management, enhances flexibility, and fosters innovation by enabling programmable networks. Instead of routers making distributed decisions, a central controller computes the best routing paths and updates flow tables in switches across the network.
