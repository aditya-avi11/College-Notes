**Unicast Routing** is the process of forwarding data packets from a single source to a single destination across a network. It is the most common form of communication on networks, where each packet is addressed to a unique destination IP address.

### Key Points:

1. **Unicast** means "one-to-one" communication. A packet is sent from one sender to one specific receiver.
2. **Routing** involves finding the best path for data to travel from the source to the destination through intermediate routers.

### How It Works:

1. **Packet Forwarding**: When a device sends data to a specific IP address, the router uses the **destination IP** to look up the routing table and determine the best path to forward the packet.
2. **Routing Table**: Each router maintains a table with routes (next hops) for different destination networks. The packet is forwarded based on this table until it reaches the final destination.
3. **Routing Protocols**: Protocols like **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)**, **RIP (Routing Information Protocol)**, and **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)** help routers exchange information about the network topology and ensure they can route packets efficiently.

### Example:

If a device with IP `192.168.1.10` wants to send a packet to another device with IP `10.0.0.5`, the routers in between will forward the packet based on their routing tables until it reaches `10.0.0.5`.

### Common Unicast Routing Protocols:

- **OSPF** (Open Shortest Path First): Uses the ==shortest path first== (SPF) algorithm to find the most efficient route.
- **RIP** (Routing Information Protocol): ==Uses hop count as the routing metric==.
- **BGP** (Border Gateway Protocol): Manages ==routing between large networks== (e.g., ISPs) on the internet.

In summary, **Unicast Routing** is a process where data is sent from one source to one specific destination using routing tables and protocols to determine the most efficient path across the network.

### Forwarding versus Routing :
**Forwarding**: 
	To select an output port based on destination address and routing table, It is Data Plane activity.
**Routing**: 
	Process by which routing table is built. 
	Populating the Routing Table which helps in forwarding IP Packets. It is Control Plane activity. 

**Two approaches to structuring network control plane:** 
- Per-router control (traditional) 
- Logically centralized control (software defined networking)

**Per-router control plane** : 
	- Individual routing algorithm components in each and every router interact in the control plane and computes the value for the forwarding table.
**Software-Defined Networking (SDN) control plane** : 
	- Remote controller computes, installs forwarding tables in routers. 
	- Control Agent (CA) present in every router interact with the controller and populate flow tables.


▪ In unicast routing, a packet is routed, hop by hop, from its source to its destination by the help of forwarding tables.

**Routing protocol goal:** 
- Determine “good” paths (equivalently, routes), from sending hosts to receiving host, through network of routers. 
- Path: sequence of routers packets traverse from given initial source host to final destination host.
- “good”: least “cost”, “fastest”, “least congested”. 
- Routing: a “top-10” networking challenge!


#### Forwarding table need : 
- **Source and Destination Hosts:** These devices typically don't need forwarding tables. They simply send packets to their local default router, which handles the routing to the destination network.
- **Intermediate Routers:** These routers, responsible for connecting different networks, need forwarding tables. They use these tables to determine the best path to forward packets based on their destination IP addresses.

# Routing Algorithms :

Two main classes of protocols used for Unicasting : 
- Distance Vector – uses Bellman Ford’s algorithm Protocol is RIP (Routing Information Protocol).
- Link State – uses Dijkstra’s algorithm Protocol is OSPF (Open Shortest Path First).

### Routing Algorithms Classification:

1. **Global (Centralized) vs. Decentralized Information**:
   - **Global**: All routers know the complete network topology and link costs. Uses **link-state** algorithms (e.g., OSPF).
   - **Decentralized**: Routers only know about their neighbors and link costs. Uses **distance-vector** algorithms (e.g., RIP).

2. **Static vs. Dynamic**:
   - **Static**: Routes change slowly over time.
   - **Dynamic**: Routes update more quickly in response to network changes, using periodic updates.

3. **Load-Sensitive vs. Load-Insensitive**:
	Link costs vary based on congestion.
   - **Load-Sensitive**: e.g., ARPAnet.
   - **Load-Insensitive**: e.g., OSPF, RIP, BGP.

5. **Routing Protocols**:
   - **Distance Vector**: Uses Bellman-Ford algorithm. Protocol: **RIP**.
   - **Link State**: Uses Dijkstra’s algorithm. Protocol: **OSPF**.

The goal is to find the lowest-cost path between nodes by minimizing the sum of link costs. Algorithms can be **static** or **dynamic** depending on how they adapt to network changes.
