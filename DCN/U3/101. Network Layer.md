## Network Layer in Computer Networks

The Network Layer is the third layer of the OSI model, ==responsible for providing logical addressing, routing, and packet switching==. It ensures that data packets are delivered reliably from the ==source host to the destination host==, even across multiple networks.

### Key Functions of the Network Layer:

1. **Logical Addressing:**
    
    - Assigns a unique logical address (e.g., IP address) to each device on a network.
    - This address is used for routing packets between different networks.
2. **Packet Switching:**
    
    - Breaks data into smaller packets (==datagrams==) for transmission over the network.
    - Each packet contains the source and destination addresses, allowing routers to determine the optimal path for delivery.
3. **Routing:**
    
    - Determines the best path for packets to travel from the source to the destination.
    - Routers use routing protocols (e.g., RIP, OSPF, BGP) to exchange information about network topology and traffic conditions.
4. **Flow Control:**
    
    - Ensures that data is not sent faster than the receiver can handle it.
    - This prevents buffer overflow and packet loss.
5. **Error Detection and Correction:**
    
    - Detects errors in transmitted data using techniques like checksums.
    - May retransmit packets if errors are detected.

### Protocols Used at the Network Layer:

- **Internet Protocol (IP):** The primary protocol for addressing and routing packets on the internet.
- **Address Resolution Protocol (ARP):** Maps IP addresses to physical addresses (MAC addresses).
- **Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP):** Used for error reporting and network diagnostics.
- **Routing Protocols:** RIP, OSPF, BGP, etc.

### Examples of Network Layer Devices:

- **Routers:** Forward packets between different networks based on their destination addresses.
- **Gateways:** Connect networks with different protocols or technologies.

**In summary,** the Network Layer plays a crucial role in ensuring reliable and efficient communication between devices on a network. It provides the necessary infrastructure for data transmission and routing, making it a fundamental component of computer networks.



## Encapsulation and Decapsulation at the Network Layer

**Encapsulation** and **decapsulation** are essential processes that occur at the Network Layer of the OSI model. These processes involve the packaging and unpacking of data as it travels through the network.

### Encapsulation

1. **Data Unit:** At the Data Link Layer, data is organized into frames.
2. **Header Addition:** The Network Layer adds a header to the frame. This header contains:
    - **Source IP Address:** The IP address of the sending device.
    - **Destination IP Address:** The IP address of the receiving device.
    - **Protocol Field:** Specifies the higher-layer protocol (e.g., TCP, UDP).
    - **Other Fields:** May include options for quality of service, fragmentation, etc.
3. **Packet Formation:** The combined frame with the header is now referred to as a **packet**.
4. **Transmission:** The packet is transmitted over the network to the next hop router.

### Decapsulation

1. **Packet Reception:** The router receives the packet.
2. **Header Removal:** The router extracts the header information from the packet.
3. **Routing Decision:** Based on the destination IP address, the router determines the next hop for the packet.
4. **Frame Formation:** The router may re-encapsulate the data into a new frame, depending on the characteristics of the outgoing link.
5. **Transmission:** The packet is forwarded to the next hop router or directly to the destination device.

**In essence:**

- **Encapsulation** adds a network layer header to a frame, creating a packet.
- **Decapsulation** removes the header from a packet, allowing the data to be processed at the Data Link Layer of the receiving device.

These processes ensure that data can be transmitted reliably across networks, even when different protocols or technologies are involved.

Network layer protocols present in every host, router. 
Router examines header fields in all IP datagram’s passing through it (it never alter the payload).

### Routers: 
- Examines header fields in all IP datagrams passing through it. 
- Moves datagrams from input ports to output ports to transfer datagrams along end-end path.

## Major Functionalities: 
1. Packetizing (fragmentation) 
2. Forwarding 
3. Routing

**Forwarding**: Move packets from router’s input port to router’s appropriate output port. 
**Routing**: Determine the route taken by packets from source to destination. To do this routers uses routing algorithms and Fills the Routing tables


## Router Operation: Forwarding Table, Data Plane, and Control Plane

A router is a network device that forwards data packets between different networks. It operates on the Network Layer of the OSI model and uses a forwarding table to make decisions about where to send packets.

### Forwarding Table

- A ==forwarding table== is a database maintained by a router that maps destination network addresses to the interface through which packets should be forwarded.
- It is typically organized as a binary search tree or hash table for efficient lookup.
- Entries in the forwarding table are learned through routing protocols or static configuration.
- ![[Pasted image 20240905075000.png]]

### Data Plane

- The data plane of a router is responsible for handling the actual forwarding of packets.
- It receives incoming packets, looks up the destination network address in the forwarding table, and forwards the packet to the appropriate interface (port).
- The data plane typically consists of hardware components such as ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits) or programmable chips to achieve high performance.

### Control Plane

- The control plane of a router is responsible for managing the router's configuration and learning routes.
- It interacts with routing protocols to exchange network topology information and update the forwarding table.
- The control plane may also handle tasks such as policy enforcement, traffic engineering, and quality of service (QoS).

**How a Router Works:**

1. **Packet Arrival:** A packet arrives at a router interface.
2. **Header Parsing:** The router extracts the destination network address from the packet header.
3. **Forwarding Table Lookup:** The router searches its forwarding table for an entry that matches the destination network address.
4. **Packet Forwarding:** If a matching entry is found, the router forwards the packet to the specified interface. Otherwise, the packet may be dropped or forwarded to a default interface.

**Example of a Forwarding Table:**

|Destination Network|Interface|
|---|---|
|192.168.1.0/24|GigabitEthernet0/0|
|10.0.0.0/8|GigabitEthernet0/1|
|Default|GigabitEthernet0/2|


In this example, packets destined for the 192.168.1.0/24 network would be forwarded out of the GigabitEthernet0/0 interface. Packets destined for networks not explicitly listed in the table would be forwarded out of the GigabitEthernet0/2 interface, which is typically configured as the default gateway.

The data plane and control plane work together to ensure efficient and reliable routing of packets within a network. The forwarding table serves as the central decision-making mechanism for routing decisions.

### 1. **Control Plane**

The control plane in networking is responsible for making decisions about ==**how** data is forwarded through a network==. It ==handles the routing and forwarding tables==, determining the ==best path== for network traffic based on protocols and algorithms.

- **Key Role**: The control plane's main function is to compute and maintain the routing tables and policies that dictate how data packets move through the network.
- **Protocols Involved**: Routing protocols such as OSPF (Open Shortest Path First), BGP (Border Gateway Protocol), and RIP (Routing Information Protocol) operate within the control plane to determine optimal paths for data traffic.

### 2. **Control Plane: Traditional Approach**

![[Pasted image 20240909071702.png]]
In the traditional networking approach, the control plane and the data plane (the part that actually forwards packets based on the control plane's decisions) are tightly integrated within network devices, such as routers and switches.

- **Integrated Control and Data Planes**: In this model, each network device has its own control plane and data plane. The control plane on each router or switch runs its own routing algorithms and manages its own forwarding table independently.
- **Distributed Architecture**: The control plane decisions (e.g., routing) are made independently on each device, and communication between devices uses routing protocols to share information.
- **Complex Management**: In large-scale networks, managing configurations and making changes across devices can be cumbersome because each device has its own control plane and must be individually managed.
- **Examples**: Traditional routing and switching devices from vendors like Cisco, Juniper, and others use this approach where routing protocols like OSPF, RIP, and BGP run on each device.

### 3. **Control Plane: Software-Defined Networking (SDN) Approach**

![[Pasted image 20240909071733.png]]
In SDN, the control plane is **separated** from the data plane and centralized, enabling more flexible and dynamic network management. This decoupling allows the network to be programmed through software interfaces, often controlled by a central controller.

- **Centralized Control Plane**: SDN uses a centralized controller (e.g., OpenFlow controller) that makes all the routing and forwarding decisions for the entire network. The control plane logic is moved to this centralized controller, while network devices (e.g., switches, routers) focus solely on forwarding data based on instructions from the controller.
- **Programmability**: With SDN, network administrators can program the network behavior and policies through software, allowing for dynamic changes to routing, load balancing, and network configuration.
- **Improved Flexibility and Scalability**: SDN simplifies network management by centralizing the control plane, making it easier to implement changes, automate tasks, and optimize the network. It also supports rapid innovation, allowing new protocols and services to be easily deployed.
- **Examples**: SDN controllers such as OpenDaylight, ONOS, and others control the forwarding devices using protocols like OpenFlow.

**Control Agent (CA) present in every router interact with the controller and populate flow tables.**

### Comparison:

|Aspect|**Traditional Approach**|**SDN Approach**|
|---|---|---|
|**Control Plane Location**|Distributed across network devices|Centralized in an SDN controller|
|**Data Plane Location**|Integrated with the control plane in devices|Separate from the control plane|
|**Management**|Manual, per-device configuration|Centralized, software-defined control|
|**Flexibility**|Less flexible, hardware-bound|Highly flexible, programmable through software|
|**Scalability**|Limited due to manual configuration|More scalable due to centralized control|

**SDN** provides a more modern, flexible way to manage complex networks by decoupling the control and data planes, simplifying management, and enabling dynamic, programmable networking.
