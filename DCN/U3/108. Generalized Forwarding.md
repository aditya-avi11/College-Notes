Review: each router contains a forwarding table (aka Flow table).
### Generalized Forwarding, Match + Action, Flow Table, OpenFlow, and Flow Table Abstraction:

These concepts are all interconnected and form the core principles of modern, flexible, and programmable networking architectures, particularly in **Software-Defined Networking (SDN)**.

### 1. **Generalized Forwarding**:

- **Definition**: Generalized forwarding refers to a flexible method of forwarding network packets based on rules that are not tied to specific protocols (like IP or Ethernet). Instead of being constrained by traditional routing tables (where the focus is on the destination IP), generalized forwarding can make decisions based on a wide range of packet attributes or header fields.
- **How It Works**:
    - In generalized forwarding, devices forward packets based on rules that consider any combination of packet fields, such as source address, destination address, protocol type, or even transport-layer fields.
    - This decouples the forwarding logic from specific networking protocols and allows more sophisticated, programmable decisions.

### 2. **Match + Action**:

- **Definition**: "Match + Action" is the basic principle behind generalized forwarding. It represents a pair of operations:
    - **Match**: Identify packets based on specific fields in the packet header (e.g., IP source address, destination port, protocol).
    - **Action**: Define what to do with those matched packets (e.g., forward, drop, modify, mirror, etc.).
- **How It Works**:
    - A network device (switch/router) examines the incoming packet, matches it against predefined rules in a flow table, and then performs the associated action based on the match.
    - **Example**: A rule might match all packets with a destination IP of `192.168.1.10` and forward them to a specific output port.


(From PPT, Important) : 
- Here the forwarding devices are called Packet switches.
- They maintain Flow Tables(match plus action tables) installed and updated by a remote controller (SDN Controller).
- Communication between controller and Packet switches is done using Openflow Protocol (we refer Openflow 1.0). 
- It is the highly visible standard for the implementation of SDN. 
- Other versions may have more capabilities.

### 3. **Flow Table**:

- **Definition**: A flow table is a structured set of rules used in generalized forwarding. It contains entries that define the "Match + Action" pairs for forwarding decisions. Each flow table entry typically consists of:
    1. **Match Fields**: Conditions that packets must meet (e.g., IP address, TCP port, MAC address).
    2. **Actions**: What to do with the matched packets (e.g., forward to a port, drop, modify header).
    3. **Counters**: Track the number of packets/bytes matched by the rule.
- **How It Works**:
    - When a packet arrives, the network device compares it against the flow table entries. Once a match is found, the corresponding action is applied.
    - If no match is found, the packet can be dropped or sent to a controller for further decision-making (as seen in SDN).

### 4. **OpenFlow**:

- **Definition**: OpenFlow is a **protocol** that enables the communication between a network device's **data plane** (the part of the device that handles packet forwarding) and a centralized **control plane** (such as an SDN controller).
- **How It Works**:
    - OpenFlow allows an SDN controller to program flow tables in switches and routers. The controller uses the OpenFlow protocol to define the "Match + Action" rules in the flow table.
    - OpenFlow provides the flexibility to manage flow entries dynamically, enabling the controller to change how packets are handled based on network conditions or policies.
- **Example**:
    - In a switch using OpenFlow, the controller can install a flow rule to forward all packets from `10.0.0.1` to `10.0.0.2` through a specific port. This rule would reside in the flow table of the switch, and OpenFlow would facilitate this interaction.

---

### 5. **Flow Table Abstraction**:

- **Definition**: Flow table abstraction refers to the idea that packet forwarding decisions are made through abstract rules in flow tables, rather than hardcoded protocol-specific logic.
- **How It Works**:
    - The flow table abstraction decouples the network forwarding logic from the underlying hardware. Instead of programming the switch or router to handle only specific types of traffic (like IP or Ethernet), flow tables can be programmed to handle any type of packet or protocol based on flexible "Match + Action" rules.
    - The abstraction allows the same hardware to handle diverse network protocols without changing the hardware logic.

### **How These Concepts Are Connected**:

1. **Generalized Forwarding** is the overarching concept that defines a flexible approach to packet forwarding, where packets are forwarded based on various attributes rather than protocol-specific routing rules.
    
2. **Match + Action** is the core mechanism that enables generalized forwarding. Each packet is matched against certain conditions (fields), and the corresponding action is applied based on the match.
    
3. **Flow Table** stores the "Match + Action" pairs. When packets arrive at a network device, they are matched against the rules in the flow table to determine how they should be handled (e.g., forwarded, dropped, etc.).
    
4. **OpenFlow** is the protocol that allows SDN controllers to interact with network devices, programming the flow tables. It gives SDN controllers centralized control over the network and enables them to dynamically configure the "Match + Action" rules in the flow tables.
    
5. **Flow Table Abstraction** allows network devices to handle a wide range of traffic types by making forwarding decisions based on abstract, programmable rules, rather than relying on rigid, protocol-specific forwarding logic.

### **Example in Practice**:

1. A packet arrives at an SDN-enabled switch.
2. The switch checks the **flow table** to see if the packet matches any predefined rules (using the **Match** part of the Match + Action).
3. If a match is found, the switch applies the corresponding **action** (forward to a port, drop the packet, etc.).
4. If no match is found, the packet is sent to the **SDN controller**.
5. The SDN controller (using the **OpenFlow** protocol) updates the flow table with a new rule, so future similar packets can be handled locally by the switch without controller intervention.

This interconnected architecture enables a more flexible, programmable, and centralized approach to networking, improving agility and efficiency in managing complex network environments.

In **Generalized Forwarding**, **orchestrated flow tables** refer to the centralized management of forwarding rules across the entire network using **OpenFlow** in **SDN (Software-Defined Networking)**.

- **OpenFlow** allows an SDN controller to control how each network device forwards packets by programming flow tables.
- These flow tables consist of **Match + Action** rules, where the device matches incoming packets to specific fields (e.g., IP address) and performs actions (e.g., forward, drop).
- By orchestrating these tables centrally, the SDN controller creates **network-wide behavior**, ensuring all devices follow coordinated traffic policies like load balancing, security rules, or traffic rerouting.
- This enables the network to adapt dynamically to changing conditions, applying policies consistently across multiple devices for efficient, real-time traffic management.

In short, **orchestrated flow tables** in SDN ensure centralized, consistent, and flexible control over packet forwarding across the entire network, achieving coordinated network behavior.
