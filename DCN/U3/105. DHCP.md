Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network management protocol ==used to automatically assign IP addresses== and other network configuration settings to devices (clients) on a network. This allows devices to communicate with each other efficiently without needing manual configuration for each device. Here’s how DHCP works:

### Key Functions of DHCP:

1. **Automatic IP Address Assignment**: DHCP automatically provides IP addresses to devices joining a network, ensuring there are no IP address conflicts.
2. **Dynamic Allocation**: The IP addresses are leased for a specific period, after which they can be reassigned to other devices if not renewed.
3. **Configuration Settings**: Along with (1.) ==IP addresses==, DHCP also provides other network settings such as the (2.) ==subnet mask==, (3.) ==default gateway==, and (4.) ==DNS server information==.
4. Allows reuse of addresses (only hold address while connected “ on ”) .
5. Support for mobile users who want to join network . Each time the user get connected to the network, it may get new address.

### How DHCP Works:

1. **DHCP Discover**: A client device that needs an IP address **broadcasts** a DHCP Discover message across the network (includes Transaction ID).
2. **DHCP Offer**: A DHCP server on the network receives the request and responds with a DHCP Offer, containing an available IP address and network configuration settings. (broadcast)
3. **DHCP Request**: The client responds with a DHCP Request message to confirm the offered IP address.  (broadcast)
4. **DHCP Acknowledgment (ACK)**: Finally, the DHCP server acknowledges the request with a DHCP ACK message, confirming that the client can use the assigned IP address otherwise DHCP NAK.  (broadcast)

It uses two well known ports – 68(client) and 67 (server).
It is an application layer protocol encapsulated in UDP datagram.
### Advantages:

- **Ease of Management**: No need for manual configuration of IP addresses.
- **Avoids IP Conflicts**: Automatic management of IP addresses prevents duplicate address assignment.
- **Scalability**: Works well in networks of any size.

### Common Uses:

- Home networks, enterprise environments, or any dynamic network where devices regularly join and leave the network.

### DHCP Lease:

The DHCP server assigns an IP address for a limited time called a **lease**. When the lease expires, the IP can be reassigned unless the client renews it.
