## Network Layer Protocols :
The network layer in version 4 can be thought of as one main protocol and three auxiliary ones:
1. The main protocol, ==IPv4==, is responsible for ==packetizing, forwarding, and delivery of a packet==.
2. The ==ICMPv4== helps IPv4 to handle some ==errors== that may occur in delivery.
3. The ==IGMP== is used to help IPv4 in ==multicasting==.
4. ==ARP== is used in ==address mapping==.

# INTERNET PROTOCOL

The **Internet Protocol (IP)** is a key component of the **Network Layer (Layer 3)** in the OSI model. It is responsible for the logical addressing and routing of packets across different networks, ensuring they reach their destination.

### Key Features of Internet Protocol:

1. **Logical Addressing**:
    
    - IP assigns unique IP addresses to each device on a network. This logical address is used to identify the source and destination of data packets. There are two main versions of IP addresses:
        - **IPv4**: 32-bit address (e.g., 192.168.1.1)
        - **IPv6**: 128-bit address (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334)
2. **Packet Routing**:
    
    - The IP layer is responsible for determining the best path (route) for the packet to take from the source to the destination across interconnected networks. Routers use IP addresses to forward packets along the most efficient path.
3. **Packet Fragmentation**:
    
    - IP can break down large packets into smaller fragments to accommodate the maximum transmission unit (MTU) of the underlying data link layer. These fragments are reassembled at the destination.
4. **Connectionless**:
    
    - IP is a connectionless protocol, meaning that each packet is treated independently. There is no established connection between the source and destination before data transmission, and packets can take different routes to reach the destination.
5. **Best Effort Delivery**:
    
    - IP provides **best effort delivery**, meaning it does not guarantee delivery, order, or integrity of packets. If a packet is lost, corrupted, or arrives out of order, IP does not handle recovery; higher-layer protocols like TCP are responsible for that.
6. **Header Information**:
    
    - The IP packet contains a header that includes important fields such as:
        - **Source IP address**
        - **Destination IP address**
        - **Time to Live (TTL)**: Limits the lifespan of a packet.
        - **Protocol field**: Identifies the protocol (e.g., TCP, UDP) being used for the payload.

### How IP Works in the Network Layer:

1. **Packet Creation**: The IP packet is created at the source with the payload (data) from the upper layers and necessary header information.
    
2. **Routing**: Routers examine the destination IP address of the packet and decide the next hop based on routing tables. The packet is forwarded across different networks using routers until it reaches its destination.
    
3. **Delivery**: Once the packet reaches the destination, the network layer forwards it to the appropriate upper-layer protocol (such as TCP or UDP) for further processing.
    

In summary, the Internet Protocol provides addressing, routing, and best-effort delivery of packets across networks, enabling global communication over the internet.

# IPv4 Datagram Format

An **IPv4 Datagram** is the ==basic unit of data in the Internet Protocol (IP)== and ==contains both the data being transmitted and the necessary information (headers)== to deliver that data to the intended destination. The structure of an IPv4 datagram is defined by a specific format called the **IPv4 Header**, which is followed by the actual payload (data).

### IPv4 Datagram Format

The IPv4 datagram consists of two parts:

1. **Header** (20-60 bytes): Contains control information about the packet.
2. **Data (Payload)**: The actual data being transmitted (maximum size of 65,535 bytes, including the header).

## Multiplexing and Demultiplexing in IPv4 Datagrams at the Network Layer

Summary :
In **IPv4**, **multiplexing** and **demultiplexing** are used to manage how data is sent and received over the network.

- **Multiplexing** at the sender's side combines data from different applications (using TCP, UDP, etc.) into IPv4 datagrams. Each datagram has a **Protocol field** that identifies the type of transport protocol (e.g., TCP = 6, UDP = 17) being used for that data.
    
- **Demultiplexing** at the receiver's side looks at the **Protocol field** in the IPv4 datagram to send the data to the correct transport protocol (like TCP or UDP) for further processing. This ensures that each application gets the right data.

### In Detail : 

**Multiplexing** and **demultiplexing** are essential processes in networking, especially at the network and transport layers. These processes allow multiple applications or services to share the same communication medium and ensure that the correct data is sent to or received by the appropriate application.

In the context of **IPv4 datagrams at the network layer**, multiplexing and demultiplexing use the **Protocol field** in the IPv4 header to identify which transport-layer protocol (e.g., TCP, UDP) should handle the data.

### 1. **Multiplexing:**

- **Multiplexing** occurs at the sender's end. It refers to the process of combining data from multiple applications (or multiple transport-layer protocols) into a single stream of IP datagrams for transmission over the network.
    
- At the sender’s machine, data packets from different higher-layer protocols (such as TCP or UDP) are **multiplexed** onto the same network-layer protocol (IPv4). The Protocol field in the IPv4 header is used to indicate the specific transport-layer protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.) that is being used for the data segment.
    
- For example:
    
    - Application A may be sending data using TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), while Application B may be using UDP (User Datagram Protocol). Both of these data segments are encapsulated in their respective transport-layer protocol headers.
    - The **Protocol field** in the IPv4 header will have a specific value (e.g., `6` for TCP or `17` for UDP) to identify which transport-layer protocol the data belongs to.
    - The IPv4 datagram is then transmitted across the network, carrying this information.

### 2. **Demultiplexing:**

- **Demultiplexing** occurs at the receiver’s end. It refers to the process of taking the incoming datagram and delivering the data to the correct transport-layer protocol based on the **Protocol field** in the IPv4 header.
    
- When the IP datagram reaches its destination, the **network layer** looks at the **Protocol field** in the IPv4 header to determine which transport-layer protocol should handle the data segment.
    
    - For example:
        - If the Protocol field contains the value `6`, the network layer knows that the data should be passed to the **TCP** layer.
        - If the Protocol field contains the value `17`, the data will be passed to the **UDP** layer.
- Once the correct transport protocol is identified (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP), the transport layer will further demultiplex the data to the correct application by looking at port numbers (which is handled by the transport layer itself).
    

### Example:

Consider a situation where two different applications are running on a computer:

1. A web browser using **TCP** to connect to a web server (HTTP).
2. A streaming service using **UDP** for media streaming.

- **Multiplexing**:
    
    - The web browser sends HTTP data via TCP (port 80) to the network layer.
    - The streaming service sends media data via UDP to the network layer.
    - The **IPv4 Protocol field** in the datagram for the web browser is set to `6` (TCP), and the Protocol field in the datagram for the streaming service is set to `17` (UDP).
- **Demultiplexing**:
    
    - When the datagrams arrive at the destination:
        - The network layer checks the Protocol field.
        - If it sees a value of `6`, it forwards the data to the **TCP** layer for processing.
        - If it sees a value of `17`, it forwards the data to the **UDP** layer for processing.

### Common Protocol Field Values in IPv4:

|Protocol|Value|
|---|---|
|ICMP|1|
|TCP|6|
|UDP|17|
|GRE|47|
|ESP|50|

### Summary:

- **Multiplexing** at the sender's side combines data from different transport-layer protocols (TCP, UDP, etc.) into IPv4 datagrams.
- **Demultiplexing** at the receiver's side uses the **Protocol field** in the IPv4 header to deliver the data to the correct transport-layer protocol for further processing.
