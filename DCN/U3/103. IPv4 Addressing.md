**IPv4 Addressing** is the system used to uniquely identify devices on a network. In the IPv4 system, each device (like a computer or router) is assigned a 32-bit address, which is divided into ==four 8-bit segments==, represented in **dotted decimal notation** (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).

### IPv4 Address Structure

An IPv4 address is 32 bits long and divided into four octets (8 bits each). Each octet is separated by a period (dot) and represented as a decimal number ranging from 0 to 255.

For example:

- Binary: `11000000 10101000 00000001 00000001`
- Decimal (IPv4): `192.168.1.1`

### Two Parts of an IPv4 Address:

1. **Network Portion**: Identifies the specific network the device belongs to.
2. **Host Portion**: Identifies the specific device (host) within that network.

The division between the network and host portions is defined by the **subnet mask**.

2. ==Classless (Subnetting, supernetting, CIDR)==
### IPv4 Address Classes

To facilitate different network sizes, IPv4 addresses are divided into classes (A, B, C, D, E), each with different ranges for network and host portions:

1. **Class A**:
    
    - Range: `1.0.0.0` to `126.255.255.255`
    - Actually it is 0-127 but 127.x.x.x is reserved for loopback addresses, so actual range is 1-126.
    - Network bits: 8 bits
    - Host bits: 24 bits
    - For very large networks (supports up to 16 million hosts)
2. **Class B**:
    
    - Range: `128.0.0.0` to `191.255.255.255`
    - Network bits: 16 bits
    - Host bits: 16 bits
    - For medium-sized networks (supports up to 65,000 hosts)
3. **Class C**:
    
    - Range: `192.0.0.0` to `223.255.255.255`
    - Network bits: 24 bits
    - Host bits: 8 bits
    - For small networks (supports up to 254 hosts)
4. **Class D**:
    
    - Range: `224.0.0.0` to `239.255.255.255`
    - Used for **multicasting** (sending data to multiple devices simultaneously).
5. **Class E**:
    
    - Range: `240.0.0.0` to `255.255.255.255`
    - Reserved for experimental use and future purposes.

### Special IPv4 Addresses:

1. **Private IP Addresses** (used within local networks):
    
    - **Class A**: `10.0.0.0` to `10.255.255.255`
    - **Class B**: `172.16.0.0` to `172.31.255.255`
    - **Class C**: `192.168.0.0` to `192.168.255.255`
2. **Loopback Address**:
    
    - `127.0.0.1` (used to test communication within the local device).
3. **Broadcast Address**:
    
    - `255.255.255.255` (used to send data to all devices in the local network).

### Subnet Mask:

A **subnet mask** is used to define the boundary between the network and host portions of an IPv4 address. It consists of a sequence of `1`s followed by `0`s. For example:

- `255.255.255.0` (binary: `11111111 11111111 11111111 00000000`) shows the first 24 bits as the network portion, and the last 8 bits as the host portion.

### CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing):

CIDR allows for more flexible addressing by using a **slash notation** to indicate the number of network bits, such as `/24` for a subnet mask of `255.255.255.0`. This enables more efficient use of IP addresses by subdividing networks.

### Summary:

- An IPv4 address is 32 bits, written as four decimal numbers.
- It has a **network portion** and a **host portion**, divided by the **subnet mask**.
- Addresses are grouped into classes (A, B, C, D, E) to handle different network sizes.
- Special addresses include private IPs, loopback, and broadcast.

### Address Depletion in IPv4:

**Address Depletion** refers to the problem of running out of available IPv4 addresses due to inefficient distribution and increasing demand. Initially, IPv4 addresses were allocated using fixed classes (A, B, C), which led to wasted addresses, especially in **Class B**. Many organizations requested Class B addresses, as Class A was too large and Class C too small, resulting in rapid depletion of Class B addresses.

#### Short-Term Solutions to Address Depletion:

1. **Subnetting:**
    
    - **Subnetting** is the process of dividing a large IP block into smaller, more manageable sub-blocks (subnets) by increasing the **network prefix length**. For example, a Class B address with a default prefix of `/16` could be split into multiple subnets with a `/24` prefix.
        
    - **Advantage**: Allows more efficient use of IP addresses by dividing larger blocks into smaller networks.
        
    - **Disadvantage**: Increases the size of the **routing tables** since each subnet is treated as a separate network.
        
    - **Example**: If you have a Class B block (`172.16.0.0/16`), you can split it into smaller subnets like `172.16.0.0/24`, `172.16.1.0/24`, etc.
        
2. **Supernetting (Route Aggregation):**
    
    - **Supernetting** (also called **route aggregation**) combines multiple smaller networks into a larger block to simplify routing. This is done by **decreasing the network prefix length**, grouping multiple smaller IP address ranges (usually Class C) into a single address block.
    - This technique helps with **reducing routing table entries**, allowing routers to handle fewer, larger blocks instead of many smaller networks.
    - **Example**: If an organization needs 700 IP addresses, rather than allocating a Class B block (which provides over 65,000 addresses), you could allocate **three Class C networks** (each providing 256 addresses) and aggregate them into a larger block (e.g., `198.100.0.0/22`).
3. **Classless Addressing (CIDR - Classless Inter-Domain Routing):**
    
    - **Classless addressing** eliminates the fixed boundaries of traditional address classes (A, B, C) and allows for more flexible allocation of IP address blocks.
        
    - Instead of being restricted by classes, blocks can have **variable-length network prefixes**, meaning organizations can receive just the right number of IP addresses needed.
        
    - This system uses **CIDR notation** (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`) to specify the number of bits used for the network portion, giving more control over address allocation.
        
    - **Advantage**: More efficient IP address usage and smaller routing tables because of ==**route aggregation**==.
        
    - **Example**: If an organization requires 500 addresses, they can be allocated a block like `192.168.0.0/23`, which provides 512 addresses, without needing an entire Class B or Class C block.
        

### Summary:

- **Address Depletion** occurred due to inefficient distribution of IPv4 addresses, especially high demand for Class B addresses.
- **Subnetting** divides larger networks into smaller subnets, increasing the number of usable networks but also increasing routing table size.
- **Supernetting** aggregates smaller networks into larger blocks to reduce routing complexity.
- **Classless Addressing** removes the rigid boundaries of address classes and allows flexible block allocation, improving efficiency and address utilization.

# Classful, Classless, CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing):

### Classful Addressing:

**Classful Addressing** is the original method used to allocate IPv4 addresses into predefined blocks, based on the first few bits of the address. It divides IP addresses into five classes (A, B, C, D, E), each with a fixed network and host portion, which made IP address management easier but inefficient as it resulted in wasted IP addresses.

#### Classes in Classful Addressing:

1. **Class A**:
    
    - **Range**: `1.0.0.0` to `126.255.255.255`
    - **Network bits**: 8 bits (first byte)
    - **Host bits**: 24 bits
    - **Total networks**: 128
    - **Total hosts per network**: ~16 million
2. **Class B**:
    
    - **Range**: `128.0.0.0` to `191.255.255.255`
    - **Network bits**: 16 bits (first two bytes)
    - **Host bits**: 16 bits
    - **Total networks**: 16,384
    - **Total hosts per network**: ~65,000
3. **Class C**:
    
    - **Range**: `192.0.0.0` to `223.255.255.255`
    - **Network bits**: 24 bits (first three bytes)
    - **Host bits**: 8 bits
    - **Total networks**: ~2 million
    - **Total hosts per network**: 254
4. **Class D**:
    
    - **Range**: `224.0.0.0` to `239.255.255.255`
    - Reserved for **multicasting** (sending data to multiple devices simultaneously).
5. **Class E**:
    
    - **Range**: `240.0.0.0` to `255.255.255.255`
    - Reserved for experimental and future use.

#### Problems with Classful Addressing:

- **Wasted IP Addresses**: Since each class has a fixed size, many addresses were wasted. For example, a company needing 500 addresses might receive a Class B block with 65,000 addresses.
- **Limited Flexibility**: The rigid class boundaries made it difficult to allocate IP addresses efficiently, leading to address depletion.

---

### Classless Addressing:

**Classless Addressing** was introduced to overcome the inefficiencies of classful addressing. Instead of fixed class boundaries (A, B, C), it uses **variable-length subnet masks (VLSM)** to allocate IP addresses based on the actual number of required hosts. This method is more flexible and efficient.

In **classless addressing**, IP addresses are represented using **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)** notation, which specifies the number of bits used for the network portion of the address.

- **CIDR Notation**: An IP address is written along with a slash (`/`) followed by the number of bits in the network portion.
    - Example: `192.168.0.0/24` means the first 24 bits are used for the network, and the remaining 8 bits are for hosts.

#### Key Concepts of Classless Addressing:

1. **Subnetting**: Dividing a large network into smaller sub-networks.
    
    - Example: Splitting `192.168.0.0/24` into `192.168.0.0/26`, `192.168.0.64/26`, etc.
2. **Supernetting**: Aggregating smaller networks into a larger network to reduce routing complexity.
    
    - Example: Combining `192.168.0.0/24` and `192.168.1.0/24` into `192.168.0.0/23`.

#### Advantages of Classless Addressing:

- **Efficient Use of IP Space**: Addresses can be allocated based on exact needs, preventing wastage.
- **Scalability**: Networks can be split or aggregated more flexibly.
- **Reduced Routing Table Size**: Through route aggregation, multiple small networks can be combined into one larger block, reducing the number of routes routers need to maintain.

(This method is used in Classless Addressing, no need to study it separately)
### CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing):

**CIDR** is a method used for more efficient allocation of IP addresses and routing on the Internet. Introduced in 1993, it allows for:

- **Removing class boundaries**: CIDR doesn’t follow the fixed classes (A, B, C), enabling the allocation of IP address blocks of any size, based on need.
- **Aggregation of networks**: CIDR enables the aggregation of multiple IP networks into a single route, which helps reduce the size of routing tables (known as **route aggregation** or **supernetting**).

#### CIDR Notation:

- **Example**: `192.168.0.0/24`
    
    - `192.168.0.0`: The base network address.
    - `/24`: The **network prefix** indicating that the first 24 bits are used for the network, and the remaining 8 bits are for host addresses.
    
    This allows up to 256 IP addresses (`2^8` = 256) in this block.

#### How CIDR Works:

- CIDR allows the flexible allocation of IP address blocks by specifying how many bits are used for the network part.
- A CIDR block like `192.168.0.0/23` provides 512 IP addresses (`2^9 = 512`), combining two Class C networks (`192.168.0.0` and `192.168.1.0`).

#### CIDR for Route Aggregation:

In CIDR, several contiguous IP networks can be aggregated into a single **supernet**. For instance, instead of routing several Class C networks separately (`192.168.0.0/24`, `192.168.1.0/24`, etc.), you could combine them into a single route as `192.168.0.0/22`.

---

### Summary of Classful vs. Classless Addressing:

- **Classful Addressing**:
    - Fixed network sizes (A, B, C) leading to inefficient use of IP addresses.
    - Wasted IP addresses in many cases due to rigid class sizes.
    - Larger routing tables due to the lack of aggregation.
- **Classless Addressing (CIDR)**:
    - Flexible IP allocation with variable-length network prefixes.
    - Efficient use of IP addresses, based on actual needs.
    - Route aggregation reduces the size of routing tables, improving the scalability of the Internet.

CIDR is widely used today to manage IP address allocation and routing more effectively, especially with the growing demand for IP addresses and limited IPv4 address space.
