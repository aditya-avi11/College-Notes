### Inter-Domain Routing â€“ BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)

**BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)** is the protocol used for inter-domain routing, which involves exchanging routing information between different autonomous systems (AS). An **Autonomous System (AS)** is a network or group of networks under a single administrative entity that uses a common routing policy.

BGP is essential for the functioning of the global internet, as it determines the best paths for data to travel across different ASes, typically belonging to different Internet Service Providers (ISPs) or organizations.

#### Key Features of BGP:

1. **Path Vector Protocol**:
   - Unlike distance-vector or link-state protocols (like RIP and OSPF), BGP is a path-vector protocol. It maintains the entire path (list of ASes) a route has traversed, allowing better control and avoiding routing loops across multiple ASes.

2. **Inter-Domain Routing**:
   - BGP handles routing between different ASes (inter-domain routing) and is mainly used on the Internet to route traffic between ISPs. It decides how packets should travel from one network (domain) to another across the internet.

3. **Types of BGP**:
   - **eBGP (External BGP)**: Used for routing between different ASes. For example, routing between two different ISPs.
   - **iBGP (Internal BGP)**: Used for routing within a single AS, typically to maintain consistency and distribute external routing information inside an AS.

4. **BGP Attributes**:
   - BGP uses several attributes to determine the best path to a destination, including:
     - **AS Path**: Lists the ASes a route has passed through.
     - **Next Hop**: The next router in the path to the destination.
     - **Local Preference**: A value used within an AS to prioritize certain routes.
     - **MED (Multi-Exit Discriminator)**: Helps determine the preferred route when multiple connections exist between two ASes.

5. **Best Path Selection**:
   - BGP uses these attributes to select the most optimal route to a destination based on policies rather than simple metrics like hop count (as in RIP). The decision is influenced by factors such as path length, local policies, and administrative decisions.

6. **Policy-Based Routing**:
   - BGP allows administrators to set routing policies based on business agreements, security, or performance, such as preferring one ISP over another. Policies can influence how traffic enters and exits an AS, enabling control over traffic flow.

7. **Reliability and Scalability**:
   - BGP is highly scalable and designed to handle the vast number of routes on the global Internet, making it the backbone of internet routing.
   - It only sends updates when there is a change in routing information, reducing bandwidth usage compared to protocols like RIP, which send periodic updates.

#### Example of BGP in Action:

Consider a scenario where an organization (AS 1) connects to two ISPs (AS 2 and AS 3) using eBGP. BGP allows AS 1 to exchange routing information with both ISPs, selecting the best path for traffic based on factors like policy, AS Path, and local preferences. For example, AS 1 might prefer sending traffic to AS 2 over AS 3 due to a better service agreement or lower costs.

### Summary:
BGP is a ==path-vector protocol== used for inter-domain routing, which controls how data is routed between different autonomous systems (ASes) on the Internet. It is highly scalable, policy-based, and plays a critical role in maintaining global internet connectivity. BGP makes decisions based on multiple attributes and ensures traffic is routed efficiently and according to organizational policies.

## Autonomous Systems :

Here's a brief explanation of each:
- Stub AS: It has only one connection to another AS. It can be a source or sink for data. Other AS data can not pass through it.
- Multihomed AS: It can have more than one connection to other Ass, but it does not allow data traffic to pass through it. - Eg: one customer AS may use services of multiple provider Ass.
- Transient AS : It is connected to more than one other AS and also allow the traffic to pass through it - Eg: Provider networks and the backbone networks
### 1. **Stub AS**:
   - A **Stub Autonomous System (AS)** has only one connection to another AS.
   - It only sends and receives traffic that originates from or is destined for its own network (no transit traffic).
   - Example: A small enterprise connected to a single Internet Service Provider (ISP).

### 2. **Multihomed AS**:
   - A **Multihomed Autonomous System** connects to multiple ASes but does **not** allow transit traffic to pass through it.
   - It connects to multiple ISPs for redundancy and reliability, but still only handles its own internal traffic.
   - Example: A larger enterprise with multiple ISP connections for failover purposes.

### 3. **Transient AS**:
   - A **Transient Autonomous System** connects to multiple ASes and **allows transit traffic** to pass through it.
   - It acts as a middleman, forwarding traffic between different ASes.
   - Example: Internet Service Providers (ISPs) that route traffic between various networks.

These terms describe how an AS interacts with other ASes in terms of routing and traffic forwarding.

## Hot Potato Routing :

**Hot Potato Routing** is a routing strategy where a network (or Autonomous System) passes traffic to a neighboring network as quickly as possible, minimizing the distance it travels within its own network.

The goal is to "offload" traffic onto other networks at the nearest exit point, rather than carrying it across the network to a farther exit, reducing internal resource usage.

### Key Points:
- It focuses on minimizing internal routing costs.
- Often used by ISPs to offload traffic to other networks quickly.
  
This approach contrasts with **Cold Potato Routing**, where the originating network keeps traffic longer, potentially choosing a more optimal path before handing it off.
