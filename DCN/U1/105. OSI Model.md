### OSI Model

#### Overview

- **Purpose**: Standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven distinct layers to facilitate ==interoperability== and communication between different systems and networks.
- **Layers**: Each layer has specific roles and communicates with the layers directly above and below it.

#### Layers of the OSI Model

1. **Physical Layer (Layer 1)**
    
    - **Function**: Deals with the physical connection between devices.
    - **Responsibilities**:
        - Transmission and reception of raw bit streams over a physical medium (e.g., cables, radio frequencies).
        - Defines hardware elements like cables, switches, network interface cards.
        - Specifies electrical, mechanical, and procedural standards.
    - **Examples**: Ethernet cables, fiber optics, physical network interfaces.
2. **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)**
    
    - **Function**: Provides node-to-node data transfer and error detection/correction.
    - **Responsibilities**:
        - ==Establishes and terminates logical link between nodes.==
        - Frames data packets.
        - ==Detects and possibly corrects errors that occur in the Physical layer.==
        - Controls access to the physical medium.
    - **Examples**: ==MAC addresses, switches, bridges, Ethernet.==
3. **Network Layer (Layer 3)**
    
    - **Function**: Manages logical addressing and routing of data packets.
    - **Responsibilities**:
        - Determines the best path to move data from source to destination.
        - Handles logical addressing (e.g., IP addresses).
        - Manages packet forwarding, including routing through intermediate routers.
    - **Examples**: IP, routers, IPv4, IPv6.
4. **Transport Layer (Layer 4)**
    
    - **Function**: Ensures reliable data transfer, flow control, and error recovery.
    - **Responsibilities**:
        - Establishes, maintains, and terminates connections between devices.
        - Segments and reassembles data for communication.
        - Ensures complete data transfer with error checking and recovery.
        - Controls data flow to prevent congestion.
    - **Examples**: TCP, UDP.
5. **Session Layer (Layer 5)**
    
    - **Function**: ==Manages sessions and controls the dialogue between applications.==
    - **Responsibilities**:
        - ==Establishes, maintains, and terminates communication sessions.==
        - ==Synchronizes data exchange== between applications.
        - Manages dialog control, ensuring that data is properly synchronized and maintained.
    - **Examples**: Session establishment protocols, APIs that manage sessions.
6. **Presentation Layer (Layer 6)**
    
    - **Function**: ==Translates data formats between applications and the network.==
    - **Responsibilities**:
        - Converts data formats to ensure that data sent from the application layer of one system is readable by the application layer of another.
        - Handles ==data encryption and decryption.==
        - Manages data compression and decompression.
    - **Examples**: Encryption protocols (SSL/TLS), data translation codecs.
7. **Application Layer (Layer 7)**
    
    - **Function**: Provides network services directly to end-user applications.
    - **Responsibilities**:
        - Interfaces directly with the end user.
        - Facilitates network services such as file transfers, email, remote login.
        - Handles resource sharing, directory services, and other application-specific operations.
    - **Examples**: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS, web browsers, email clients.

### Summary

- **Purpose**: OSI model standardizes network communication into seven layers.
- **Layers**:
    1. **Physical**: Physical connection, raw bit transmission.
    2. **Data Link**: Node-to-node data transfer, error detection.
    3. **Network**: Logical addressing, routing.
    4. **Transport**: Reliable data transfer, flow control.
    5. **Session**: Session management, synchronization.
    6. **Presentation**: Data translation, encryption/decryption.
    7. **Application**: End-user network services, application interfaces.

Each layer has specific functions and interacts with the layers directly above and below it to facilitate effective communication across the network.
