# 101. Network Core - Multiplexing and Switching

***==Multiplexing==*** :
- It is the process of sharing the Link bandwidth among different channels by dividing it into pieces and allocating it to individual channels which happens at the sending side.
- Multiplexing is a technique used to combine and send the multiple data streams over a single medium.
- **Purpose**: It maximizes the use of the available bandwidth and improves the efficiency of data transmission.

***==Demultiplexing==*** : 
- It is the reverse of that which happens at the receiving side.
- **Definition**: Demultiplexing is the process of separating the combined signals or data streams back into their original, individual signals at the receiver's end.
- **Purpose**: Ensures that the original signals can be accurately retrieved and used by the receiving system.
- **Process**:
    - The receiver identifies the multiplexed signals.
    - It then uses the appropriate method (frequency, time slot, or packet headers) to separate and route each signal to its respective destination.


## Types of Multiplexing (3) :

### 1. Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM)

- **Description**: With FDM, the bandwidth is divided into n pieces (frequency bands) and allocated to n channels.
	- FDM divides the available bandwidth of a communication channel into multiple frequency bands, each carrying a separate signal simultaneously.
	- Here a small portion of the bandwidth is assigned to each channel for the ==whole time==.
- **Use Case**: Analog systems like radio and TV broadcasting.
- **Example**: In radio broadcasting, different radio stations broadcast at different frequencies within the same frequency spectrum.
- ==Drawback==: If there is no information to communicate in a particular channel after sometime, then the frequency level gets wasted.

### 2. Time Division Multiplexing (TDM )

With TDM, the time is divided into n time slots and assigned to each channel in a round robin fashion.
Here each channel gets the full bandwidth at the assigned time slot.
- **Description**: TDM divides the available time on a communication channel into slots. Each slot is allocated to a different signal, allowing multiple signals to share the same channel but at different times.
- **Use Case**: Digital communication systems like telephone networks.
- **Example**: In digital telephony, multiple phone calls can share the same communication line by allocating each call a specific time slot in a repeating cycle.
- ==Drawback==: If there is no information to communicate after sometime, then the time slot gets wasted.

### 3. Statistical Multiplexing

▪ To overcome the drawback of FDM and TDM, we have Statistical Multiplexing.
▪ Like TDM, the time is divided into n time slots and assigned to each channel in a round robin fashion.
▪ But the time slots are assigned to channels on demand.

- **Description**: Unlike FDM and TDM, statistical multiplexing dynamically allocates bandwidth to signals based on their current demand. It uses available channel capacity more efficiently by not reserving fixed slots or frequencies.
- **Use Case**: Packet-switched networks like the Internet.
- **Example**: In data networks, packets from multiple sources share the same transmission line. Bandwidth is allocated based on the traffic load, ensuring efficient use of resources.

# Switch in Computer Networks

#### Definition

A switch is a networking device that connects devices within a local area network (LAN) and uses packet switching to forward data to specific devices on the network.

#### Key Functions

1. **Data Forwarding**: Receives incoming data packets, inspects their destination addresses, and forwards them to the appropriate output ports to reach their intended devices.
2. **MAC Address Table**: Maintains a table of MAC (Media Access Control) addresses and corresponding ports, allowing it to make intelligent forwarding decisions.
3. **Collision Domain**: Reduces the size of collision domains, ensuring that each connected device has a dedicated connection, which minimizes collisions and improves network efficiency.


- A switch is a device which forward data from a link to another link when required.
- It can be done in two ways :
1. Circuit Switching 
2. Packet Switching

More notes of below : [[100. Internet Overview & Structure]]
### 1. Circuit Switching

#### Definition

Circuit switching is a method of communication where a dedicated communication path is established between two endpoints for the duration of the session.

*A Circuit-Switched network is made of a set of switches connected by physical links, in which each link is divided into n channels.*
*It has 3 phases :*
1. ==*Setup phase== - resources need to be reserved.*
2. *==Data Transfer== - resources remain dedicated for the entire duration.*
3. ==*Teardown== - resources are released.*
*Here dedicated resources: no sharing.*
*Circuit-like (guaranteed) performance.*
*It uses FDM and TDM.*
*Eg: Telephone Network.*

#### Key Characteristics

- **Dedicated Path**: A fixed path is established and reserved for the entire duration of the communication.
- **Continuous Connection**: The connection remains active and exclusive until the communication session ends.
- **Resource Allocation**: Network resources (e.g., bandwidth) are allocated for the entire session, regardless of whether data is being transmitted at all times.

#### Use Case

- **Traditional Telephone Networks**: When you make a phone call, a dedicated circuit is established between your phone and the receiver’s phone, ensuring continuous voice transmission.

#### Example

- **Phone Call**: A call is placed, and a continuous circuit is established through various switches, connecting the caller and receiver directly until the call ends.

### 2. Packet Switching

#### Definition

Packet switching is a method of communication where data is broken into smaller packets and each packet is transmitted independently over the network.

*In a packet-switched network, there is no resource reservation.*
*Resources are allocated on demand.*
*A switch uses the store and forward concept (queues).*
*A switch (layer-3) uses a routing table that is based on the destination address.* 
*Switching in the Internet is done by using the packet switching at the network layer.* 
*Packets may encounter some delays, Packet Loss could be there.*
*E.g: TCP/IP network*
*Packet switching is great for bursty data (internet)* 
- *resource sharing* 
- *simpler, no call setup* 
*In case of excessive congestion: packet delay and loss protocols needed for reliable data transfer, congestion control*.
*Packet switching allows more users to use network!*

#### Key Characteristics

- **No Dedicated Path**: Unlike circuit switching, there is no fixed path; packets can take different routes to reach the destination.
- **Efficient Resource Use**: Network resources are used as needed, allowing for efficient utilization and sharing among multiple users.
- **Packets**: Data is divided into packets, each containing part of the data along with headers for routing and reassembly information.

#### Use Case

- **Internet**: Most modern data networks, including the Internet, use packet switching to transmit data.

#### Example

- **Web Browsing**: When you load a webpage, the data is broken into packets. Each packet may take a different route to reach your device, where they are reassembled to display the webpage.
