# Data Comm & Network
- **PAN (Personal Area Networks)**:
    
    - A PAN is a small network used for connecting devices within the range of an individual person, typically within a range of a few meters.
    - Examples: Bluetooth, Wi-Fi Direct.
- **LAN (Local Area Networks)**:

    - A LAN is a network that connects devices within a limited geographical area, such as a home, school, or office building.
    - Examples: Ethernet, Wi-Fi.
- **MAN (Metropolitan Area Networks)**:
    
    - A MAN covers a larger geographical area than a LAN, typically a city or a large campus.
    - Examples: Cable TV networks, high-speed internet services in cities.
- **WAN (Wide Area Networks)**:
    
    - A WAN spans a large geographical area, often a country or continent, connecting multiple LANs and MANs.
    - Examples: The Internet, long-distance telephone networks.

# Overview of Internet

### Creation of Packets

- **Segmentation and Headers**: At the sending end, data is divided into smaller segments. Each segment is then encapsulated with ==header bytes that contain information such as source and== ==destination addresses, sequence numbers, and error-checking codes.==
### Data Forwarding

- **Packet Switch**: A packet switch (such as a router) receives packets from an incoming communication link. It reads the header information to determine the destination and forwards the packet to the appropriate outgoing communication link. This process is repeated until the packet reaches its final destination.



- **End Systems get Internet Access through ISPs.** 
- **All pieces of the internet, end systems, switches, routers etc. have to follow protocols.**
- **Protocols control sending, receiving of messages e.g., TCP, IP, HTTP, VoIP, Ethernet .**
- **Protocols need to be standardized.**
- **Internet Standards -Developed by IETF and have RFC numbers.**
- **The IETF standards documents are called RFCs (Request for comments) (more technical and detailed).**


The Internet acts as an infrastructure providing services to applications, which may be distributed. These services include:
- **Reliable Data Delivery**: Ensuring data is delivered from source to destination reliably (connection-oriented).
- **Best Effort Delivery**: Providing data delivery without guarantees of reliability (connectionless).

End systems offer APIs, like socket interfaces, which are governed by protocols.
Protocols define format, order of messages sent and received among network entities, and actions taken on message transmission and receipt.
Analogy â€“ Postal system



### Internet as a Switched Network

- **Switch**: A device that connects at least two links together, forwarding data between them as needed.

### Types of Switching

1. **Circuit Switching**:
    
    - Establishes a ==dedicated communication path== between two endpoints for the duration of the session.
    - Always available.
    - Example: Traditional telephone networks.
2. **Packet Switching**:
    
    - ==Data is divided into packets==, which are sent independently over the network and reassembled at the destination.
    - Uses store and forward technique
    - Example: The Internet, Postal System.

In summary, in a switched network, a switch facilitates the transfer of data between different links, using either circuit switching for dedicated paths or packet switching for more flexible, efficient data transmission.

# Internet Structure

An internet is a switched network. (Network of Networks)
Interconnection of ISPs (Internet Service Providers).
Internet is a combination of links, Switches and Routers.

### Types of ISPs :
- **Tier-1 ISPs**:
    
    - Major national/international providers like Verizon, Sprint, AT&T.
    - Have extensive coverage and treat each other as equals, forming the core of the Internet.
    - **Tier 1 ISPs** are the largest ISPs and form the backbone of the internet. They have direct access to all other networks on the internet without having to pay for peering.
- **Tier-2 ISPs**:
    
    - Smaller, often regional providers.
    - Connect to one or more Tier-1 ISPs and may also connect to other Tier-2 ISPs.
    - **Tier 2 ISPs** purchase transit from Tier 1 ISPs but also engage in peering with other networks. They offer regional or national coverage.
- **Tier-3 ISPs**:
    
    - Local providers.
    - Serve as the last hop, providing access to end users and connecting to Tier-2 ISPs.
    - **Tier 3 ISPs** purchase transit from Tier 1 and Tier 2 ISPs and focus on providing internet access to end customers.

### Connecting End Systems to the Internet

- **Access ISPs**: End systems (like homes, companies, and universities) connect to the Internet through access ISPs.
- **Interconnection**: Access ISPs are interconnected to allow any two hosts to communicate.
- **Complex Network**: This interconnection creates a complex network of networks.
- **Evolution**: The development of this network was influenced by economic factors and national policies.


# Given millions of access ISPs, how to connect them together?
Ans- Using IXPs

Connecting millions of access ISPs together involves a hierarchical structure of ISPs to ensure efficient data routing and communication:

1. **Local (Tier-3) ISPs**:
    
    - Serve individual customers and small businesses.
    - Connect to regional (Tier-2) ISPs.
2. **Regional (Tier-2) ISPs**:
    
    - Aggregate connections from multiple Tier-3 ISPs.
    - Connect to national/international (Tier-1) ISPs.
    - May peer with other Tier-2 ISPs to improve regional connectivity.
3. **National/International (Tier-1) ISPs**:
    
    - Form the backbone of the Internet.
    - Connect directly with other Tier-1 ISPs to create a global network.
    - Provide connectivity to Tier-2 ISPs, ensuring that data can travel across the globe.
4. **Internet Exchange Points (IXPs)**:
    
    - Physical locations where multiple ISPs interconnect.
    - Facilitate efficient data exchange and reduce the distance data needs to travel.
5. **Peering Agreements**:
    
    - ISPs negotiate peering agreements to exchange traffic without charging each other.
    - Helps balance loads and improve connectivity.

By using this hierarchical structure and strategic interconnections, the vast number of access ISPs can efficiently connect, allowing data to flow seamlessly across the Internet.

# Internet Exchange Point (IXP)

#### What is an IXP?

- An Internet Exchange Point (IXP) is a physical infrastructure where multiple Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and network operators meet to exchange Internet traffic between their networks.
- This reduces costs, lowers latency, increases bandwidth, and enhances network resilience by facilitating efficient data exchange among numerous networks.

#### Why Do We Need IXPs?

- **Cost Efficiency**: Directly exchanging traffic at an IXP reduces the need for expensive transit through third-party networks, lowering costs for ISPs.
- **Reduced Latency**: Local traffic is exchanged locally, reducing the distance data must travel and improving speed and latency.
- **Increased Bandwidth**: IXPs provide high-bandwidth connections, allowing for faster data transfer and improved network performance.

#### How IXPs Help Connect Millions of ISPs Together:

1. **Direct Peering**: ISPs can peer directly with each other, avoiding the need for intermediaries and thus simplifying the network path.
2. **Traffic Aggregation**: IXPs act as hubs where multiple ISPs converge, facilitating efficient data exchange between numerous networks.
3. **Network Resilience**: By providing multiple interconnection points, IXPs enhance the redundancy and reliability of the Internet infrastructure.
4. **Scalability**: As more ISPs connect to an IXP, the network effect increases, making it easier for new ISPs to join and interconnect with existing networks.

### ==Example==

Consider a city with multiple local ISPs. Instead of each ISP needing separate connections to every other ISP, they all connect to a local IXP. At the IXP, they can exchange traffic directly, improving efficiency and performance. This model scales up to regional, national, and international levels, forming a complex but efficient network of networks.
#### Without IXP:
- ISP A needs a direct link to ISP B.
- ISP A needs a direct link to ISP C.
- ISP B needs a direct link to ISP C.
This results in multiple, redundant connections, increased costs, and potentially higher latency.
#### With IXP:
- **Step 1**: All three ISPs connect to a central IXP.
- **Step 2**: ISP A, ISP B, and ISP C exchange traffic through the IXP.

**Benefits:**
1. **Cost Efficiency**: ISPs save money by using a single connection to the IXP instead of multiple direct connections.
2. **Reduced Latency**: Data exchanged locally through the IXP reduces the distance it must travel, improving speed.
3. **Increased Bandwidth**: The IXP provides high-capacity connections, allowing for faster data exchange.
