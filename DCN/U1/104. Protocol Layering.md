https://www.omnisecu.com/tcpip/tcpip-encapsulation-decapsulation.php


### 1. Encapsulation at the Source Host

**Message -> Segment -> Packet (Datagram) -> Frame -> Bits**

- **Message**: This is the original data that the application layer wants to send. It can be any form of data such as a ==file, email, or a request.==
    
- **Segment**: The transport layer (e.g., TCP or UDP) takes the message and breaks it into smaller chunks called segments. Each segment is given a transport layer header containing control information such as ==source and destination ports, sequence numbers, and error-checking data.==
    
- **Packet (Datagram)**: The network layer (e.g., IP) takes each segment and adds its own header to create a packet (or datagram). This header includes ==source and destination IP addresses, and other routing information.==
    
- **Frame**: The data link layer takes each packet and adds its own header and trailer to create a frame. The header typically contains MAC addresses (source and destination), while the trailer often includes error-checking data like a CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check). ==Error detection and correction, flow control.==
    
- **Bits**: Finally, the physical layer converts the ==frame into a series of bits (0s and 1s)== that can be transmitted over the physical medium (e.g., electrical signals over a wire, radio waves in wireless communication).
    

### 2. Decapsulation and Encapsulation at Router

When a packet passes through a router, the router will perform decapsulation and then encapsulation.

- **Decapsulation**:
    
    - The router receives bits and converts them into frames at the physical layer.
    - The data link layer decapsulates the frame to extract the packet.
    - The network layer examines the packetâ€™s header to make routing decisions.
- **Encapsulation**:
    
    - The network layer may make changes to the packet header if necessary (e.g., decrementing the TTL field).
    - The data link layer encapsulates the packet in a new frame suitable for the next hop on its path.
    - The physical layer converts the frame into bits for transmission over the appropriate physical medium.

### 3. Decapsulation at the Destination Host

**Bits -> Frame -> Packet (Datagram) -> Segment -> Message**

- **Bits**: The destination host receives the stream of bits over the physical medium.
    
- **Frame**: The physical layer converts the bits back into a frame.
    
- **Packet (Datagram)**: The data link layer decapsulates the frame to extract the packet.
    
- **Segment**: The network layer decapsulates the packet to extract the segment.
    
- **Message**: The transport layer decapsulates the segment to reconstruct the original message, which is then delivered to the application layer.
