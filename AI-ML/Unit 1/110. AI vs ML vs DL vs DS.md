## Difference Between AI, ML, DL, and DS

|Term|Definition|Connection to Other Terms|
|---|---|---|
|**Artificial Intelligence (AI)**|The simulation of human intelligence in machines, especially computer systems. This includes tasks like learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.|AI encompasses ML and DL as its subsets.|
|**Machine Learning (ML)**|A subset of AI that involves algorithms that allow computers to learn from data and improve their performance on a specific task without being explicitly programmed.|ML is a subset of AI and uses DL techniques for complex tasks.|
|**Deep Learning (DL)**|A subset of ML that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to learn complex patterns from data.|DL is a subset of ML and is used for complex tasks like image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and self-driving cars.|
|**Data Science (DS)**|The interdisciplinary field of extracting insights from data using scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems. It involves collecting, cleaning, analyzing, and interpreting data.|DS uses AI, ML, and DL techniques to extract insights from data.|

**Connections between AI, ML, DL, and DS:**

- **AI** is the overarching field that seeks to create intelligent machines, and **ML** and **DL** are subsets that provide the tools and techniques to achieve this.
- **ML** is a subset of **AI** that focuses on algorithms for learning from data, and **DL** is a subset of **ML** that uses deep neural networks for complex learning tasks.
- **DS** uses **AI**, **ML**, and **DL** to extract insights from data, employing techniques like data cleaning, feature engineering, and model building.

In essence, AI is the broad goal, ML provides the framework, DL offers a powerful set of tools, and DS applies these to real-world data to extract meaningful information.
