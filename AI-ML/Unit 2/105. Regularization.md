Regularization in machine learning refers to techniques used to reduce model complexity, prevent overfitting, and improve generalization to unseen data. Overfitting occurs when a model performs well on the training data but poorly on test data due to being overly complex and fitting noise or outliers in the training data. Regularization helps avoid this by adding a penalty term to the loss function that the model is trying to minimize.

There are two common types of regularization:

### 1. **L1 Regularization (Lasso)**
   - **Description**: Adds the absolute values of the coefficients as a penalty to the loss function.
   - **Effect**: Encourages sparsity, meaning it can drive some of the coefficients to exactly zero, effectively selecting important features and performing feature selection.
   - **Mathematical Formulation**:
     
		     $\text{Loss function} = \text{Original Loss} + \lambda \sum_{i} |w_i|$
     
     where $w_i$ are the model coefficients, and $\lambda$ is the regularization strength.

### 2. **L2 Regularization (Ridge)**
   - **Description**: Adds the square of the coefficients as a penalty to the loss function.
   - **Effect**: Shrinks the coefficients but does not make them zero. It helps distribute the influence of features more evenly across the model.
   - **Mathematical Formulation**:
     
		     $\text{Loss function} = \text{Original Loss} + \lambda \sum_{i} w_i^2$
     
     where $w_i$ are the model coefficients, and $\lambda$ is the regularization strength.

### 3. **Elastic Net Regularization**
   - **Description**: Combines both L1 and L2 regularization. It includes a mix of the absolute and squared values of the coefficients.
   - **Effect**: ==It benefits from both the feature selection property of L1 and the smoothness of L2 regularization.==
   - **Mathematical Formulation**:
     
		     $\text{Loss function} = \text{Original Loss} + \lambda_1 \sum_{i} |w_i| + \lambda_2 \sum_{i} w_i^2$
     

### How Regularization Helps:
- **Prevents Overfitting**: By penalizing large coefficients, regularization discourages the model from becoming too sensitive to individual data points.
- **Improves Generalization**: Models with smaller, more constrained coefficients are less likely to overfit and more likely to generalize to unseen data.
- **Feature Selection (in L1)**: Helps simplify the model by automatically selecting the most relevant features.

The strength of the regularization is controlled by a hyperparameter \(\lambda\), which needs to be fine-tuned for optimal model performance.
