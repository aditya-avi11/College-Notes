## Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

These are common metrics used to evaluate the performance of regression models. They measure the difference between the predicted values and the actual values.

### Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

- **Formula:** MAE = (1/n) * Σ |yi - ŷi|
- **Explanation:** Calculates the average absolute difference between the predicted values (ŷi) and the actual values (yi).
- **Interpretation:** A lower MAE indicates a better model, as it means the model's predictions are closer to the true values on average.

### Mean Squared Error (MSE)

- **Formula:** MSE = (1/n) * Σ (yi - ŷi)^2
- **Explanation:** Calculates the average squared difference between the predicted values and the actual values.
- **Interpretation:** Squaring the differences amplifies larger errors. A lower MSE indicates a better model, but it can be sensitive to outliers.

### Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

- **Formula:** RMSE = √((1/n) * Σ (yi - ŷi)^2)
- **Explanation:** The square root of the MSE.
- **Interpretation:** Brings the units of error back to the original scale. It is often preferred over MSE because it is easier to interpret.

**Key Differences:**

- **Sensitivity to outliers:** MSE and RMSE are more sensitive to outliers than MAE, as squaring large differences amplifies their impact.
- **Units:** MAE and RMSE are in the same units as the target variable, while MSE is in squared units.
- **Interpretation:** MAE is easier to interpret directly, while MSE and RMSE are often used for optimization purposes.

**Choosing the right metric:**

- **MAE:** If you want a metric that is less sensitive to outliers and is easier to interpret directly.
- **MSE:** If you want a metric that is more sensitive to large errors and is often used for optimization purposes.
- **RMSE:** If you want a metric that is in the same units as the target variable and is often used for optimization purposes.

In practice, the choice of metric often depends on the specific problem and the goals of the analysis.
